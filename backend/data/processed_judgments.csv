Manohar Reddy & Ors on 30 September, 2010 Author: Mukundakam Sharma Bench: Anil R. Dave, Mukundakam Sharma REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NOS. 4212-4223 OF 2004 lA.P. HOUSING BOARD .... Appellant Versus K. MANOHAR REDDY & ORS. .... Respondents JUDGMENT Dr. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA, J. 1. The present appeals are filed by the appellant and are directed against the judgment and order dated 08.06.2001 passed by the High Court holding that the respondents-claimants are entitled to compensation at the rate of Rs. 75/- per square yard for the acquired lands after deducting 1/3rd from the said amount, i.e., Rs. 25/- per square yard, along with other benefits as awarded by the Civil Court. 2. The State Government of Andhra Pradesh by issuing a notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 [hereinafter referred to as ""the Act""] on 16.01.1985, which was published in the Gazette on 17.04.1985, proposed to acquire an extent of land measuring 84 acres 24 guntas of land situated in Survey Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14 and 108 of Pothireddipalli village, Sangareddy Mandal, Medak District. The aforesaid notification was followed by a notification under Section 6 of the Act. The Land Acquisition Officer thereafter, taking into consideration the sale transactions of adjoining lands for a period of three years prior to the publication of notification in question, passed an award determining the market value of the land in question at Rs. 36,000/- per acre. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1695360/ 1 A.P. Housing Board vs K. Manohar Reddy & Ors on 30 September, 2010 3. The respondent-claimants being dissatisfied with the aforesaid award passed by the Land Acquisition Officer, sought for a reference under Section 18 of the Act to the Civil Court claiming compensation at Rs. 100/- per square yard for the acquired land. Consequent to the said prayer, a reference case was registered. The respondents-claimants examined eight witnesses and also produced some documents on record in the nature of sale deeds exhibited as A1 to A15. On behalf of the Land Acquisition Officer, documents were produced which were exhibited as B1 to B22. 4. The District Judge, who heard the reference case, after considering the oral and documentary evidence produced before him, passed a common judgment and order dated 29.12.1997 fixing the market value of the land acquired at Rs. 50/- per square yard and also awarded 30 per cent solatium on the market value and a further sum of 12 per cent additional market value in terms of the Section 23(1)(A) of the Land Acquisition Act. The Civil Court also awarded interest at 9 per cent per annum for the first year and 15 per cent per annum thereafter. 5. The respondents-claimants, still aggrieved, filed appeals before the High Court under Section 54 of the Act. The Land Acquisition Department of the Government of Andhra Pradesh and the appellants herein also filed appeals before the High Court contending inter alia that the reference court was not justified in determining compensation on the basis of square yards of land when a large extent of land measuring 84 acres 24 guntas had been acquired. Another contention that was raised on behalf of the State was that the reference court should have at least made deduction towards development charges which could have been done in the range between 33 per cent to 65 per cent since the land acquired was a large tract of land whereas the exemplar is small plot of land. 6. Contention of the respondents on the other hand in their appeals was that similarly situated lands were sold for Rs. 200/- per square yards to Rs. 300/- per square yards and, therefore, the valuation fixed by the reference court should be enhanced. 7. The aforesaid appeals were heard by the High Court and by a common judgment and order dated 08.06.2001 the Court, taking into consideration the generality of the situation and the proximity of the land in question to industrial establishments and its potentiality, held that the claimants were entitled to compensation of Rs. 75/- per square yard for the acquired lands and then deducted 1/3rd from the said amount, which is Rs. 25/- per square yard, and consequently held that the respondents-claimants would be entitled for payment of compensation at the rate of Rs. 50/- per square yard with other benefits as awarded by the Civil Court. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment and order, the Andhra Pradesh Housing Board has filed the present appeals on which we have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties. 8. The evidence adduced by the witnesses and the documents relied upon and referred to by the courts below were also placed before us which we have carefully scrutinized. Out of the 15 exhibits, viz., Exhibits A1 to A15, which are sale deeds produced and exhibited by the respondents-claimants before the reference court, what is really relevant for our purpose are Exhibits A1 to A9, as they pertain to lands situated at Survey No. 8 which are similar to the land which was sought to be acquired under the notification in question. The aforesaid sale deeds were executed apriori the date of the notification issued under Section 4(1) of the Act. Exhibits A1 to A5 relate to transactions of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1695360/ 2 A.P. Housing Board vs K. Manohar Reddy & Ors on 30 September, 2010 sales of land in Survey No. 8 at the rate of Rs. 50/- per square yard, Exhibits A6 & A7 relate to transaction of sales of land in Survey No. 13 at the rate of Rs. 60/- per square yard and Exhibit A9 relates to transaction of sale of land in Survey No. 4 at the rate of Rs. 48.30 per square yard. Another important aspect which is to be noted at this stage is that the proposal for acquisition of this land was initiated on 12.10.1982. In light of the said fact, one of the contentions of the appellants was that the aforesaid purchase of property under all the sale deeds were made in anticipation of acquisition of land thereby showing inflated rate of sale. 9. It is true that all the aforesaid Exhibits which are produced by the respondents-claimants were executed after 12.10.1982 when the aforesaid proposal for acquisition was initiated. It is also clear from the evidence on record that J. Subbiah [PW-3] who was examined in the reference case is also the claimant No. 7 and was a signatory to Exhibit A9 and is also related to Deva Sahayam [PW-2] who was the vendor. Similarly, Narayana Goud [PW-5] purchased the land from PW-2 in respect of Exhibit A3 whereas PW-5 is signatory in sale deeds, viz., Exhibits A1 and A2. But, the fact remains that the land which is acquired is very ideal and suitably located, there being a court house and bus stand in proximity to the acquired land. There is also evidence on record indicating that the acquired land is abutting the main highway. Therefore, the acquired land has potential value to be properly used and developed even for housing project or to exploit it for commercial purposes. The acquired land, although classified as agricultural land, could always be converted to land of good quality by making investments like filling up of the land, providing road, sewage system and other civic amenities. The land in question having such potential value could, therefore, be converted to a land of good quality by investing money towards its development. 10. This Court while dealing with the admissibility of the sale deed in the case of Cement Corporation of India Ltd. v. Purya & Ors. reported in (2004) 8 SCC 270 at paragraph 28 held that even the vendor or vendee to a sale deed are not required to be examined themselves for proving the contents thereof if the contents of the sale deed are held to be admissible by Court in accordance with law: - ""28. Section 51-A of the LA Act may be read literally and having regard to the ordinary meaning which can be attributed to the term `acceptance of evidence' relating to transaction evidenced by a sale deed, its admissibility in evidence would be beyond any question. We are not oblivious of the fact that only by bringing a documentary evidence in the record it is not automatically brought on the record. For bringing a documentary evidence on the record, the same must not only be admissible but the contents thereof must be proved in accordance with law. But when the statute enables a court to accept a sale deed on the records evidencing a transaction, nothing further is required to be done. The admissibility of a certified copy of sale deed by itself could not be held to be inadmissible as thereby secondary evidence has been brought on record without proving the absence of primary evidence. Even the vendor or vendee thereof is not required to examine themselves for proving the contents thereof. This, however, would not mean that the contents of the transaction as evidenced by the registered sale deed would automatically be accepted. The legislature advisedly has used the word `may'. A discretion, therefore, Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1695360/ 3 A.P. Housing Board vs K. Manohar Reddy & Ors on 30 September, 2010 has been conferred upon a court to be exercised judicially, i.e. upon taking into consideration the relevant factors."" 1. This Court in a catena of decisions has laid down that when a large tract of land is acquired and sale instances produced for small plots as exemplar, the best course for the court to arrive at a reasonable and fare valuation is to deduct a reasonable percentage from the valuation shown in the exemplar land and on the basis thereof to arrive at a just and fair valuation. In Rishi Pal Singh and Others vs. Meerut Development Authority and Anr. reported in (2006) 3 SCC 205, this Court while dealing with the issue relating to a large tract of land held as follows:- 5.......With respect to the first reason, that is, exemplars of small plots have been taken into consideration by the Reference Court, in the first instance our attention was invited to some judgments of this Court to urge that there is no absolute bar to exemplars of small plots being considered provided adequate discount is given in this behalf. Thus there is no bar in law to exemplars of small plots being considered. In an appropriate case, especially when other relevant or material evidence is not available, such exemplars can be considered after making adequate discount. This is a case in which appropriate exemplars are not available. The Reference Court has made adequate discount for taking the exemplars of small plots into consideration............ In Administrator General of West Bengal v. Collector, Varanasi, reported at (1988) 2 SCC 150, this Court held (paragraph 12) that where large tracts of land are required to be valued, valuation in transactions with regard to small plots cannot directly be adopted for valuing the compensation of large tracts of land. ""12. It is trite proposition that prices fetched for small plots cannot form safe bases for valuation of large tracts of land as the two are not comparable properties. The principle that evidence of market value of sales of small, developed plots is not a safe guide in valuing large extents of land has to be understood in its proper perspective. The principle requires that prices fetched for small developed plots cannot directly be adopted in valuing large extents. However, if it is shown that the large extent to be valued does not admit of and is ripe for use for building purposes; that building lots that could be laid out on the land would be good selling propositions and that valuation on the basis of the method of hypothetical lay out could with justification be adopted, then in valuing such small, laid out sites the valuation indicated by sale of comparable small sites in the area at or about the time of the notification would be relevant. In such a case, necessary deductions for the extent of land required for the formation of roads and other civil amenities; expenses of development of the sites by laying out roads, drains, sewers, water and electricity lines, and the interest on the outlays for the period of deferment of the realisation of the price; the profits on the venture etc. are to be made. In Sahib Singh Kalha v. Amritsar Improvement Trust this Court indicated that deductions for land required for roads and other developmental expenses can, together, come up to as much as 53 per cent. But the prices fetched for small plots cannot directly be applied in the case of large areas, for Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1695360/ 4 A.P. Housing Board vs K. Manohar Reddy & Ors on 30 September, 2010 the reason that the former reflects the ""retail"" price of land and the latter the ""wholesale"" price."" 1. On the admissibility and relevance of sale deeds, this Court in Ranvir Singh & Anr. V. Union of India reported in (2005) 12 SCC 59 held as follows: - ""31. Furthermore, it is well settled that the sale deeds pertaining to the portion of lands which are subject to acquisition would be the most relevant piece of evidence for assessing the market value of the acquired lands."" ""36. Furthermore, a judgment or award determining the amount of compensation is not conclusive. The same would merely be a piece of evidence. There cannot be any fixed criteria for determining the increase in the value of land at a fixed rate. .................."" 1. It was held in the case of Union of India & Anr. v. Ram Phool & Anr. reported in (2003) 10 SCC 167 that : - ""6. ............ the sale price in respect of a small bit of transaction would not be the determinative factor for deciding the market value of a vast stretch of land. ........"" 1. In the case of Kasturi & Ors. v. State of Haryana reported in (2003) 1 SCC 354 this Court held as follows: - ""7. ............. It is well settled that in respect of agricultural land or undeveloped land which has potential value for housing or commercial purposes, normally 1/3rd amount of compensation has to be deducted out of the amount of compensation payable on the acquired land subject to certain variations depending on its nature, location, extent of expenditure involved for development and the area required for roads and other civic amenities to develop the land so as to make the plots for residential or commercial purposes. A land may be plain or uneven, the soil of the land may be soft or hard bearing on the foundation for the purpose of making construction; maybe the land is situated in the midst of a developed area all around but that land may have a hillock or may be low-lying or may be having deep ditches. So the amount of expenses that may be incurred in developing the area also varies. A claimant who claims that his land is fully developed and nothing more is required to be done for developmental purposes, must show on the basis of evidence that it is such a land and it is so located. In the absence of such evidence, merely saying that the area adjoining his land is a developed area, is not enough particularly when the extent of the acquired land is large and even if a small portion of the land is abutting the main road in the developed area, does not give the land the character of a developed area. In 84 acres of land acquired even if one portion on one side abuts the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1695360/ 5 A.P. Housing Board vs K. Manohar Reddy & Ors on 30 September, 2010 main road, the remaining large area where planned development is required, needs laying of internal roads, drainage, sewer, water, electricity lines, providing civic amenities etc. However, in cases of some land where there are certain advantages by virtue of the developed area around, it may help in reducing the percentage of cut to be applied, as the developmental charges required may be less on that account. There may be various factual factors which may have to be taken into consideration while applying the cut in payment of compensation towards developmental charges, maybe in some cases it is more than 1/3rd and in some cases less than 1/3rd. It must be remembered that there is difference between a developed area and an area having potential value, which is yet to be developed. The fact that an area is developed or adjacent to a developed area will not ipso facto make every land situated in the area also developed to be valued as a building site or plot, particularly when vast tracts are acquired, as in this case, for development purpose."" 1. Further, in the case of Shaji Kuriakose & Anr. v. Indian Oil Corpn. Ltd. and Ors. reported in (2001) 7 SCC 650, this Court held that: - ""3. It is no doubt true that courts adopt comparable sales method of valuation of land while fixing the market value of the acquired land. While fixing the market value of the acquired land, comparable sales method of valuation is preferred than other methods of valuation of land such as capitalisation of net income method or expert opinion method. Comparable sales method of valuation is preferred because it furnishes the evidence for determination of the market value of the acquired land at which a willing purchaser would pay for the acquired land if it had been sold in the open market at the time of issue of notification under Section 4 of the Act. However, comparable sales method of valuation of land for fixing the market value of the acquired land is not always conclusive. There are certain factors which are required to be fulfilled and on fulfilment of those factors the compensation can be awarded, according to the value of the land reflected in the sales. The factors laid down inter alia are: (1) the sale must be a genuine transaction, (2) that the sale deed must have been executed at the time proximate to the date of issue of notification under Section 4 of the Act, (3) that the land covered by the sale must be in the vicinity of the acquired land, (4) that the land covered by the sales must be similar to the acquired land, and (5) that the size of plot of the land covered by the sales be comparable to the land acquired. If all these factors are satisfied, then there is no reason why the sale value of the land covered by the sales be not given for the acquired land. However, if there is a dissimilarity in regard to locality, shape, site or nature of land between land covered by sales and land acquired, it is open to the court to proportionately reduce the compensation for acquired land than what is reflected in the sales depending upon the disadvantages attached with the acquired land. ..............."" Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1695360/ 6 A.P. Housing Board vs K. Manohar Reddy & Ors on 30 September, 2010 1. In Lal Chand v. Union of India & Anr., reported at (2009) 15 SCC 769, this Court while determining the rate at which development charges may be deducted, held (paragraph 8): ..The percentage of 'deduction for development' to be made to arrive at the market value of large tracts of undeveloped agricultural land (with potential for development), with reference to the sale price of small developed plots, varies between 20% to 75% of the price of such developed plots, the percentage depending upon the nature of development of the lay out in which the exemplar plots are situated. The 'deduction for development' consists of two components. The first is with reference to the area required to be utilised for developmental works and the second is the cost of the development works.... ....9. Therefore the deduction for the 'development factor' to be made with reference to the price of a small plot in a developed lay out, to arrive at the cost of undeveloped land, will be for more than the deduction with reference to the price of a small plot in an unauthorized private lay out or an industrial layout. It is also well known that the development cost incurred by statutory agencies is much higher than the cost incurred by private developers, having regard to higher overheads and expenditure. Even among the layouts formed by DDA, the percentage of land utilized for roads, civic amenities, parks and play grounds may vary with reference to the nature of layout - whether it is residential, residential- cum-commercial or industrial; and even among residential layouts, the percentage will differ having regard to the size of the plots, width of the roads, extent of community facilities, parks and play grounds provided. Some of the layouts formed by statutory Development Authorities may have large areas earmarked for water/sewage treatment plants, water tanks, electrical sub-stations etc. in addition to the usual areas earmarked for roads, drains, parks, playgrounds and community/civic amenities. The purpose of the aforesaid examples is only to show that the `deduction for development' factor is a variable percentage and the range of percentage itself being very wide from 20% to 75%. 1. It is, therefore, implicit from the aforesaid discussion of case law and precedent that whatever could be deducted towards development charges for developing a particular plot of land could range between 20 per cent to 75 per cent. This is a very wide bracket, no doubt, but an appropriate deduction befitting the situation, location and the nature of the land justifying the deduction made could be arrived at upon estimation of all the aforesaid factors. If the land is already developed and could be used as a commercial/residential plot, what should be deducted would be in the lower side whereas if development is to be made, like filling up of the land, providing of roads, sewage and other civic amenities, etc., the range of the deduction could be higher. 2. Considering the facts and circumstances of the present case, and the situation of the land, what could be an appropriate deduction in our estimation is 1/3 rd from the awarded amount towards development charges. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1695360/ 7 A.P. Housing Board vs K. Manohar Reddy & Ors on 30 September, 2010 We have referred to the evidence adduced in this case which shows that the land is agricultural land and therefore would require extensive development to be utilised as a residential site. 3. The High Court interfered with the rate of market value fixed by the reference court and raised it to Rs. 75/- per square yard from Rs. 50/- per square yard as fixed by the reference court and thereafter deducted 1/3rd from the aforesaid rate towards the development charges. However, the High Court has not given any reason, let alone cogent reasons, for increasing the aforesaid rate from Rs. 50/- to Rs. 75/-. Such a course was also not permissible in view of the clear evidence which was relied upon and exhibited by the claimants-respondents themselves, presented as Exhibits A1 to A9. Those were sale deeds which were executed in proximity to the date of acquisition and there is also evidence on record to indicate that the proposal for acquisition of the acquired land was initiated as on 12.10.1982. Therefore, such an increase without any supporting reasons cannot be said to be valid and legal. 4. Therefore, relying on the Exhibits which were produced by the claimants-respondents and which are found as a reliable yardstick for determining the valuation in the present case, we determine the market value of the land at Rs. 50/- per square yard as on the date of the notification and direct that 1/3rd of the awarded amount shall be deducted from the aforesaid valuation towards development charges. It is needless to point out here that the respondents shall also be entitled to the statutory benefits as provided for under Section 23(1), 28 and 34 of the Act for which the decision rendered in the case of Sunder v. Union of India reported in (2001) 7 SCC 211 which was later affirmed and elaborated in the case of Gurpreet Singh vs. Union of India reported in (2006) 8 SCC 457 would be applicable. 5. We accordingly allow these appeals. However, we leave the parties to bear their own costs. ............................................J [Dr. Mukundakam Sharma ] ............................................J [ Anil R.

The respondent whose name was listed by the Board of Indian Medicine, Uttar Pradesh in the register of Vaids and Hakims practised as a Vaid and as an Ayurvedic Doctor in Agra and Bhopal respectively. He migrated to Bombay in 1962 where he started practice as an Ayurvedic Doctor. He applied for registration as a medical practitioner to the Committee of the Medical Board of Unani system of Medicine under sub- section (5) of section 17 of the Act. His application was rejected, and his appeal filed to the Board was also dismissed. The High Court, however, allowed the respondent's writ petition, relying on its earlier decision in Rukmani Hoondraj Hingorani v. The Appellate Authority under the Maharashtra Medical Practitioner Act, 1961 (1969) 71 Bom.

It was observed in that case that the provision, by restricting the right of enlistment to those medical practitioners 'who have been regularly practising on 4th November, 1951 in the Bombay area of the State' had no rational nexus with the object of the Legislature which was to allow medical practice by those less qualified persons who were too old to choose alternative means of livelihood, and that while it was clearly open to the Legislature to provide that a person must have been practising for a certain number of years, or from before a particular date, in order that his name may be included in the list, no distinction on the basis of the area in which he had been practising could be made.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1757616/ 2 A. T. Zambre And Others vs Kartar Krishna Shashtri on 17 December, 1980 From the Judgment and Order dated 8-11-1968 of the Bombay High Court in S.C.A. No. 2087/68. M. C. Bhandare, C. K. Sucharita and M. N. Shroff for the Appellant. Nemo for the Respondent. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KOSHAL J., This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment dated November 8, 1968 of a Division Bench of the High Court of Bombay allowing a petition under articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India and declaring that sub-s. (5) of s. 17 of the Maharashtra Medical Practitioners Act, 1961 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) is ultra vires of article 14 of the Constitution of India. The facts are not in dispute and may be shortly stated. The respondent hails from Uttar Pradesh. In 1940 he obtained the degree of ""Ayurved Shastri"" from the All India Adarsh Vidwat Parishad, Kanpur. On November 12, 1940 his name was listed by the Board of Indian Medicine, Uttar Pradesh, in the register of Vaids and Hakims. He practised as a Vaid in Agra thereafter upto 1955 when he migrated to Bhopal where he was registered as an Ayurvedic Doctor by the Medical Council of the Government of Bhopal under the Bhopal Medical Practitioners Registration Act, 1935. He migrated to Bombay in 1962 and started practising there as an Ayurvedic Doctor. However, in the meantime, i.e., on November 23, 1961, the Act came into force, except for Chapter VI thereof which came into operation on November 1, 1966. The respondent's application for registration as a medical practitioner made to the Committee of the Medical Board of Unani System of Medicine under sub-s. (5) of s. 17 of the Act (although none of the clauses of that sub-section had anything to do with it) was rejected and his appeal filed to the Board was also dismissed on September 30, 1964. Clause (ii) of the said sub-s. (5) with which we are concerned provides that any person not being a person qualified for registration under sub-ss. (3) or (4) who proves to the satisfaction of the Committee appointed under sub-s. (6) ""that he was on the 4th day of November 1941 regularly practising the Ayurvedic or the Unani System of Medicine in the Bombay area of the State, but his name was not entered in the register maintained under the Bombay Medical Practitioners Act, 1938"" shall be entitled to have his name entered in the register on making an application on the prescribed form, on payment of a fee of Rs. 10/- and production of such documents as may be prescribed by the rules. The expression ""Bombay area of the State of Maharashtra"" is defined in sub-s. (6) of s. 3 of the Bombay General Clauses Act to mean ""the area of the State of Maharashtra excluding the Vidarbha region and the Hyderabad area of that State."" A contention was raised before the High Court on the strength of Rukmani Hoondraj Hingorani v. The Appellate Authority under the Maharashtra Medical Practitioners Act, 1961 that sub-s. (5) of s. 17 of the Act fell foul of article 14 of the Constitution, and that contention was accepted. We may usefully refer to the following observations made in the decision just above cited: ""Confining our attention, however, to medical practitioners practising in the Bombay area of the State, we find it difficult to appreciate why the right of enlistment should have been restricted to those who were regularly practising on 4th November 1951, Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1757616/ 3 A. T. Zambre And Others vs Kartar Krishna Shashtri on 17 December, 1980 `in the Bombay area of the State'. Since the object of the Legislature was to allow medical practice by those less qualified persons who were too old to choose alternative means of livelihood, it was clearly open to the Legislature to provide that a person must have been practising for a certain number of years, or from before a particular date, in order that his name may be included in the list. It was thus open to the Legislature to provide that, out of unregistered and unlisted medical practitioners who were practising in the Bombay area of the State, only those would be entitled to have their names included in the list who were practising regularly from before the 4th of November, 1951. It is, however, not possible to find any rational basis for the provision that medical practitioners in the Bombay area of the State, in order to be entitled to enlistment, must not only have been practising regularly from 4th November, 1951, but must have been practising on that day `in the Bombay area of the State'. The provision that medical practitioners must have been practising on 4th November, 1951 in the Bombay area of the State has no rational nexus with the object of the Legislature which was to ensure that medical practitioners, who were not fully qualified but who were too old to choose alternative means of livelihood, should not be deprived of their practice. In order to illustrate the discriminatory nature of the provision contained in s. 18(2)(b)(ii), we shall take imaginary instances of five persons who were all practising in the Bombay area of the State at the time of their applications under s. 18 (i.e., on or before 31st March, 1965) and who were not already enlisted and were not entitled to registration under the Act. Let us suppose that one of them, A, was practising continuously in Bombay City from 1950 to 1963, when he applied under s. 18 of the Act. Since on 4th November, 1951 he was practising regularly 'in the Bombay area of the State', he is clearly entitled to have his name included in the list. Let us take another person B who practised in Poona from 1950 to 1954 and in Bombay City from 1954 to 1963 when he applied under s. 18. He is also entitled to enlistment because Poona falls in the Bombay area of the State. We may then take the instance of C who practised in Nagpur from 1950 to 1954 and in Bombay City from 1954 to 1963. He would not be entitled to have his name included in the list, because on 4th November, 1951 he was regularly practising in Nagpur which, though situated in Maharashtra, is not included in the Bombay area of the State. We will next take the instance of D who practised in Baroda, then a part of the Bombay State, from 1950 to 1954 and thereafter in Bombay City from 1954 to 1963. He is also not entitled to enlistment, since Baroda in out side the State of Maharashtra. Similar would be the position of another person E who practised in Bhopal from 1950 to 1954 and then in Bombay City from 1954 to 1963. No rational explanation can be given of why A and B should receive the said concession from the Legislature and should be able to continue their practice and why C, D and E should not receive the concession and should be deprived of their practice."" We find ourselves in complete agreement with these observations which were made in relation to sub-clause (ii) of clause (b) of sub-s. (2) of s. 18 of the Act. The provisions of that sub-clause being in Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1757616/ 4 A. T. Zambre And Others vs Kartar Krishna Shashtri on 17 December, 1980 pari materia with sub-s. (5) of s. 17 of the Act, they apply fully to that sub-section which must therefor be held to be violative of article 14 of the Constitution. Accordingly we have no hesitation in upholding the impugned judgment and dismiss this appeal, but with no order as to costs as the respondent has not appeared before us to contest it. N.V.K. Appeal dismissed. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1757616/ 5"

Chauhan, P. Sathasivam REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1243 OF 2007 Abdul Sayeed ... Appellant Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh ...Respondent WITH CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1399 OF 2008 Rafique ... Appellant Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh ...Respondent AND CRIMINAL APPEAL NOS.1363-1365 OF 2010 Rais @ Toun & Ors. ...Appellants Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh ....Respondent JUDGMENT Dr. B.S. CHAUHAN, J. 1. All the aforesaid appeals have been filed against the common judgment and order dated 12.1.2006, of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur in Criminal Appeal Nos.1191 of 1998; 1210 of 1998; and 281 of 2001 by which the appellants have been convicted under Sections 302/34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter called IPC) for committing the murders of Chand Khan and Shabir Khan, while setting aside their conviction under Sections 147 and 148 IPC awarded by the Trial Court. 2. Facts and circumstances giving rise to these appeals are that on 16.8.1994 at about 7.50 p.m., F.I.R. No.1/1994 under Sections 302, 147, 148, 149 and 307 IPC was lodged at Police Station Mandai Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126399/ 1 Abdul Sayeed vs State Of M.P on 14 September, 2010 Chowk Sarangpur, Madhya Pradesh, according to which 17 accused including 5 appellants armed with deadly weapons came from the mosque way; stopped Chand Khan and started beating him with weapons with an intention to kill him. After hearing the hue and cry made by Chand Khan, his wife Zaira Banu, sons Shabir (deceased), Anees (PW.1), and Ashfaq (PW.2), and brother Usman Ali (PW.4) came running to the place of occurrence and after seeing the incident, they were so scared that they could not muster the courage to intervene immediately. After some time Zaira Banu, Shabir and Ashfaq tried to rescue Chand Khan. Shabir was also assaulted, he was seriously injured and died on the spot. Ashfaq (PW.2), and his mother Zaira Banu also got injuries on their persons at the hands of the accused. 3. The Investigating Officer sent the dead bodies for post-mortems which were conducted by Dr. R.P. Sharma (PW.3). In his opinion, the cause of death of both Chand Khan and Shabir was excessive hemorrhage resulting in injuries to brain and lungs. Ashfaq (PW.2) was also examined medically. After completing the investigation, out of the seventeen accused, fourteen were put to trial for offences under Sections 148, 302 and 323, in the alternative 302/149, 324/149 and 323/149 IPC. One Nanhe Khan @ Abdul Wahid died before commencement of trial. One accused namely, Rais S/o Mumtaz is still absconding. While Iqbal @ Bhura, appellant, had also absconded, but afterwards he surrendered and was tried separately. The appellants and the other accused denied the charges and pleaded that they were falsely implicated and claimed trial. The prosecution examined 12 witnesses including Anees (PW.1), Ashfaq (PW.2) and Usman Ali (PW.4), as eye-witnesses. The other relevant witnesses were Dr. R.P. Sharma (PW.3) who conducted the post-mortems on the bodies of the deceased, Ramesh Kumar Dubey (PW.7) and Rajmal Sharma (PW.8) who had investigated the case. The appellants examined 4 witnesses in defence. 4. After conclusion of the trial, the Special Additional Sessions Judge, Shajapur, convicted Abdul Sayeed (A.11), Mumtaz Khan (A.9), Rafiq (A.6) and Rais (A.5) under Section 148 IPC and awarded a sentence of 3 years' imprisonment to each; Mumtaz (A.9) was sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment under Section 147; Mumtaz (A.9) and Abdul Sayeed (A.11) were sentenced to Rigorous Imprisonment for life and fine of Rs.2000/- under Section 302 IPC for committing murder of Chand Khan; Rais @ Toun (A.5) and Rafiq (A.6) were sentenced to Rigorous Imprisonment for life and fine of Rs.1000/- under Section 302 IPC for committing murder of Shabir; Sayeed (A.7) was convicted under Section 324 IPC and given 2 years Rigorous Imprisonment for causing injuries to Ashfaq (PW.2); Hanif Khan (A.1), was convicted under Sections 304 Part-II, 323 and 147 IPC for causing injuries to Shabir. Iqbal alias Bhura, appellant also got convicted in separate Sessions Trial No.190/94 vide judgment and order dated 11.1.2001, under Sections 148 and 302 IPC and was awarded Rigorous Imprisonment of 3 years and life imprisonment respectively along with certain fines. 5. All the said convicts filed Criminal Appeal Nos.1191/98; 1210/98; 1233/98; and 281/2001 before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh. The State of Madhya Pradesh also filed Criminal Appeal No.1447/98 against the acquittal of some of the accused for offences under Sections 302/149, 324/149 and 323/149 IPC. As all the appeals related to the same incident, the High Court disposed of all the appeals by the common judgment and order dated 12.1.2006 wherein the appellants had been convicted as mentioned hereinabove, i.e., under Sections 302/34 IPC setting aside their Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126399/ 2 Abdul Sayeed vs State Of M.P on 14 September, 2010 conviction under Sections 147/148 IPC. The High Court allowed Criminal Appeal No.1191/98 with regard to the other co-accused, Hanif Khan, Bashir Khan, Sayeed and Aslam. The appeal filed by the State of Madhya Pradesh was partly allowed. Hence, these appeals. 6. All these appeals have arisen from the same incident and have been filed against the common judgment of the High Court and thus, are being heard together. 7. Shri Fakhruddin, learned Senior counsel, Shri Ranbir Singh Yadav and Ms. Rakhi Ray, learned counsel appearing for the appellants, have submitted that in case the High Court had set aside the conviction of all the appellants and other co-accused under Sections 147/148 IPC, question of convicting them with the aid of Section 34 IPC did not arise, even otherwise no charge under Section 34 IPC was framed by the Trial Court; nor any evidence had been led to show that offences had been committed by the appellants in furtherance of a common intention. Essential ingredients of Section 34 IPC, i.e., that a common intention was shared, has not been established by the prosecution. More so, the weapons allegedly used for committing the offences by the appellants do not tally with the ocular evidence of the eye-witnesses. Therefore, injuries caused to the deceased and other injured persons cannot be attributed to the appellants. Conviction under Sections 302/34 IPC is unwarranted and thus, the appeals deserve to be allowed. 8. On the other hand, Shri C.D. Singh, learned counsel appearing for the State, has vehemently opposed the appeals contending that not framing the charge under Section 34 IPC is not fatal to the prosecution and the High Court has rightly convicted the appellants under Sections 302/34 IPC. Seventeen persons came to the spot armed with deadly weapons with a common intention to kill Chand Khan. They surrounded Chand Khan and started causing injuries to him. In such a fact-situation the eye-witnesses may not describe exactly what role had been played by an individual assailant. If there are small omissions in the depositions of the eye- witnesses, the same require to be ignored. The injured witnesses have to be relied upon and even in case there is some conflict between the ocular evidence and medical evidence, the ocular evidence has to be preferred. Therefore, the appeals lack merit and are liable to be dismissed. 9. We have considered the rival submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record. 10. As mentioned hereinabove, 17 persons had allegedly participated in the crime. As per the prosecution, on the date of occurrence, i.e., 16.8.1994 at about 11 A.M., one Kamla Bai, daughter of Dev Karan, neighbour of informant Anees (PW.1) was molested by Munim Khan and Mumtaz Khan (accused/appellant) in the fields of Faqir. Smt. Gora Bai, mother of Kamla Bai, complained to Chand Khan with regard to the said incident. Chand Khan (since deceased), went to advise the uncle of Munim Khan and Pappu alias Chote Khan in this regard and scolded them. He also gave one slap to one of the accused. The appellants and other co-accused did not like the conduct of Chand Khan and in the evening the appellants and the co-accused committed the offence mentioned hereinabove. In fact, this had been the motive for commission of the offence. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126399/ 3 Abdul Sayeed vs State Of M.P on 14 September, 2010 11. Out of the seventeen accused, ten stood acquitted by the courts below. One of them is still absconding. One had died prior to the commencement of the trial. Only five accused/appellants have been convicted by the High Court. Therefore, we are concerned only with the cases of these appellants. Making reference to any of the other co-accused at this stage would not serve any purpose. 12. As per the Autopsy Report (Ex.P/7-A), prepared by Dr. R.P. Sharma (PW.3) in respect of Chand Khan, the following external injuries were noticed:- 1. Incised wound on head at occipital region, 1.5 cm x 1 x bone deep with fracture. 2. Incised wound on right parietal region 2.5 cm x = x bone deep fracture of right parietal bone, clotted blood on cerebral membrane. 3. Incised wound on left leg 10 cm x 2 cm upto bony region of Tibia. 4. Stab wound on left side of chest between 3rd and 4th rib deep upto lung 1.5 cm x = cm x deep upto left lung puncture. 5. Incised wound on left arm of posterior surface 5 cm x 2 cm x = cm. 6. Lacerated wound over the left eye 1 cm x = cm x < cm. In the opinion of the doctor grievous injures to vital organs i.e. head and lungs caused excessive haemorrhage which resulted in death. 13. Dr. R.P. Sharma (PW.3) also performed Autopsy on the body of Shabir Khan and gave Post-Mortem Report Ex.P/8-A. In this report he duly noted the external injuries as under:- 1. Incised wound on head at right frontal level to right ear underneath frontal bone fracture. 2. Incised wound over the left parietal region 4, ="" x bone deep . 3. One lacerated wound over the occipital region ="" x <"" x <"". 4. Stab injury on the right side chest 1"" x <"" x <"". 5. Stab injury on the right side chest 1"" x ="" x deep upto lung. 6. Incised wound on left shoulder 2, ="" x ="" x ="". 7. Incised wound on right arm ="" x ="" x ="". Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126399/ 4 Abdul Sayeed vs State Of M.P on 14 September, 2010 8. Incised wound on right arm 1"" x <"" x <"". The Autopsy Surgeon opined that on account of grievous injury to vital parts i.e. head and chest caused excessive haemorrhage which resulted in coma and death. Cause of death was Syncope. 14. Dr. M.K. Vashistha (PW.5) the Medical Specialist at Biaora, examined Ashfaq (PW.2) and prepared the report (Ex.P.10), according to which, he had sustained four injuries as under: 1. Incised wound 1 x 1/6 x 1/6 cm right side of the neck. 2. One bruise red 3 x 1 cm on the left arm. 3. Patient had complained of pain in the left leg but there was no external injury. 4. Abrasion on hip size = x = cm. The injuries were simple. 15. So far as Abdul Sayeed (A.11) is concerned, as per the prosecution he had a knife of 8"" and assaulted Chand Khan. It is evident from the evidence of Anees (PW.1), Ashfaq (PW.2) and Usman Ali (PW.4) that Chand Khan received cut injuries and stab wounds as found by Dr. R.P. Sharma (PW.3). As per the medical report, his left lung was found punctured due to a stab wound. The knife used in the crime was recovered by the Investigating Officer at the instance of the said appellant. He has also caused injury to Ashfaq (PW.2), an eye-witness. In view of the above, the trial Court as well as the High Court reached the conclusion that he was one of the accused persons responsible for the death of Chand Khan. 16. So far as Rais alias Toun (A.5) is concerned, as per the evidence of Anees (PW.1), Ashfaq (PW.2) and Usman Ali (PW.4) when Shabir (since deceased), came to save his father Chand Khan, Rais Khan (A.5) attacked Shabir with sword. Dr. R.P. Sharma (PW.3) who examined Shabir deposed that the injuries suffered by Shabir were the result of the use of the weapon assigned to Rais alias Toun as well as other co-accused. Rais alias Toun had the sword which resulted these wounds. The trial Court as well as the High Court have found Rais responsible for killing Shabir. 17. So far as Rafiq (A.6) is concerned, as per the evidence of Anees (PW.1), Ashfaq (PW.2) and Usman Ali (PW.4), Rafiq used a Gupti for committing the crime. Injuries caused with the Gupti were found by Dr. R.P. Sharma (PW.3) on the body of Shabir. The Gupti used by Rafiq was 18"" in length and 1-1/2"" in thickness and it was sharp like a knife. The trial Court as well as the High Court recorded the specific finding that the wound found on the body of Shabir was by plying Gupti and this was done by appellant Rafiq on Shabir (deceased). 18. So far as Mumtaz Khan (A.9) is concerned, as per the evidence of all the three eye-witnesses, he was holding a Farsi and had beaten Chand Khan. There was a cut wound on the head of Chand Khan due to which the bone of the occipital region cracked and Dr. R.P. Sharma (PW.3) deposed that he had found the skull wound which resulted in cracking of the skull. The trial Court as well as the High Court, after appreciating the entire evidence on record came to the conclusion that Mumtaz Khan Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126399/ 5 Abdul Sayeed vs State Of M.P on 14 September, 2010 took an active part in beating Chand Khan, due to which he died spontaneously. 19. So far as Iqbal alias Bhura is concerned, as per the evidence of Anees (PW.1), Ashfaq (PW.2) and Usman Ali (PW.4), he had a sword and assaulted Shabir and the injury caused by him has been duly supported by the medical evidence. The trial Court convicted him vide judgment and order dated 11.1.2001 in a separate trial. The trial Court and the High Court found him guilty for committing murder of Shabir. 20. Ashfaq (PW.2) has stated that all the accused surrounded his father and attacked him with their weapons from all sides. He has named Rais alias Toun, Mumtaz Khan, Abdul Sayeed and Iqbal alias Bhura. It is also evident from his deposition that while running away from the place of occurrence they mocked him and said: ""however many of you come, we will see the end of you."" This shows that there was a common intention. Ashfaq has also explained how he had been injured. Anees (PW.1) has also deposed regarding the participation of all the five appellants and has explained what weapons they were carrying and how they had caused injuries to his father and brother. He has deposed that Chand Khan was killed by Abdul Sayeed and Mumtaz Khan and Shabir by Iqbal alias Bhura, Rais alias Toun and Rafiq. Usman Ali (PW.4), has named all the appellants along with the other co-accused who have been acquitted by the Courts below and has given full details of the incident. He also deposed that while causing the injuries, the culprits were shouting ""kill them kill them"". He denied the suggestion that the appellants had not caused injury to Shabir and also denied the suggestion that Iqbal was not present there at the time of incident. He also denied the suggestion that Mumtaz Khan and Abdul Sayeed did not cause any injury to Chand Khan with Farsi and knife respectively. 21. It has strenuously been argued on behalf of the appellants that the injuries found on the person of victims could not be caused with the weapons alleged to have been with the appellants and the same cannot be in consonance with the ocular evidence of Anees (PW.1), Ashfaq (PW.2) and Usman Ali (PW.4). Thus, appellants are entitled for the benefit of doubt as there is clear cut contradiction between the ocular and medical evidence. Identification in a Crowd of Assailants: 22. In cases where there are a large number of assailants, it can be difficult for a witness to identify each assailant and attribute a specific role to him. In Masalti v. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1965 SC 202, this Court held as under:- ""Where a crowd of assailants who are members of an unlawful assembly proceeds to commit an offence of murder in pursuance of the common object of the unlawful assembly, it is often not possible for witnesses to describe accurately the part played by each one of the assailants. Besides, if a large crowd of persons armed with weapons assaults the intended victims, it may not be necessary that all of them have to take part in the actual assault. In the present case, for instance, several weapons were carried by different members of the unlawful assembly, but it appears that the guns were used and that was enough to kill 5 persons. In such a case, it would be unreasonable to contend that because the other weapons carried by the members of the unlawful assembly were not used, the story in regard to the said weapons itself Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126399/ 6 Abdul Sayeed vs State Of M.P on 14 September, 2010 should be rejected. Appreciation of evidence in such complex case is no doubt a difficult task; but criminal courts have to do their best in dealing with such cases and it is their duty to sift the evidence carefully and decide which part of it is true and which is not."" [Emphasis added] 23. A similar view was taken by this Court in Kallu alias Masih & Ors. v. State of Madhya Pradesh, (2006) 10 SCC 313; and Viji & Anr. v. State of Karnataka, (2008) 15 SCC 786 observing that in such a case it is not possible that all the witnesses may specifically refer to the acts of each assailants. 24. In Bhag Singh & Ors. v. State of Punjab (1997) 7 SCC 712, while dealing with a similar contention, this Court observed: ""It is a general handicap attached to all eyewitnesses, if they fail to speak with precision their evidence would be assailed as vague and evasive, on the contrary if they speak to all the events very well and correctly their evidence becomes vulnerable to be attacked as tutored. Both approaches are dogmatic and fraught with lack of pragmatism. The testimony of a witness should be viewed from broad angles. It should not be weighed in golden scales, but with cogent standards. In a particular case an eyewitness may be able to narrate the incident with all details without mistake if the occurrence had made an imprint on the canvas of his mind in the sequence in which it occurred. He may be a person whose capacity for absorption and retention of events is stronger than another person. It should be remembered that what he witnessed was not something that happens usually but a very exceptional one so far as he is concerned. If he reproduces it in the same sequence as it registered in his mind the testimony cannot be dubbed as artificial on that score alone."" 25. In the instant case, a very large number of assailants attacked Chand Khan and Shabir (deceased), caused injuries with deadly weapons to them. The incident stood concluded within few minutes. Thus, it is natural that the exact version of the incident revealing every minute detail, i.e., meticulous exactitude of individual acts cannot be given by the eye-witnesses. Injured Witness 26. The question of the weight to be attached to the evidence of a witness that was himself injured in the course of the occurrence has been extensively discussed by this Court. Where a witness to the occurrence has himself been injured in the incident, the testimony of such a witness is generally considered to be very reliable, as he is a witness that comes with a built-in guarantee of his presence at the scene of the crime and is unlikely to spare his actual assailant(s) in order to falsely implicate someone. ""Convincing evidence is required to discredit an injured witness"". (Vide Ramlagan Singh & Ors. v. State of Bihar, AIR 1972 SC 2593; Malkhan Singh & Anr. v. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1975 SC 12; Machhi Singh & Ors. v. State of Punjab, AIR 1983 SC 957; Appabhai & Anr. v. State of Gujarat, AIR 1988 SC 696; Bonkya alias Bharat Shivaji Mane & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra, (1995) 6 SCC 447; Bhag Singh & Ors. (supra); Mohar & Anr. v. State of Uttar Pradesh, (2002) 7 SCC 606; Dinesh Kumar v. State of Rajasthan, (2008) 8 SCC 270; Vishnu & Ors. v. State of Rajasthan, (2009) 10 SCC 477; Annareddy Sambasiva Reddy & Ors. v. State of Andhra Pradesh, AIR 2009 SC 2261; Balraje alias Trimbak v. State of Maharashtra, (2010) 6 SCC 673). Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126399/ 7 Abdul Sayeed vs State Of M.P on 14 September, 2010 27. While deciding this issue, a similar view was taken in, Jarnail Singh v. State of Punjab, (2009) 9 SCC 719, where this Court reiterated the special evidentiary status accorded to the testimony of an injured accused and relying on its earlier judgments held as under:- ""Darshan Singh (PW 4) was an injured witness. He had been examined by the doctor. His testimony could not be brushed aside lightly. He had given full details of the incident as he was present at the time when the assailants reached the tubewell. In Shivalingappa Kallayanappa v. State of Karnataka, 1994 Supp (3) SCC 235, this Court has held that the deposition of the injured witness should be relied upon unless there are strong grounds for rejection of his evidence on the basis of major contradictions and discrepancies, for the reason that his presence on the scene stands established in case it is proved that he suffered the injury during the said incident. In State of U.P. v. Kishan Chand, (2004) 7 SCC 629, a similar view has been reiterated observing that the testimony of a stamped witness has its own relevance and efficacy. The fact that the witness sustained injuries at the time and place of occurrence, lends support to his testimony that he was present during the occurrence. In case the injured witness is subjected to lengthy cross- examination and nothing can be elicited to discard his testimony, it should be relied upon (vide Krishan v. State of Haryana, (2006) 12 SCC 459). Thus, we are of the considered opinion that evidence of Darshan Singh (PW 4) has rightly been relied upon by the courts below."" 28. The law on the point can be summarised to the effect that the testimony of the injured witness is accorded a special status in law. This is as a consequence of the fact that the injury to the witness is an in-built guarantee of his presence at the scene of the crime and because the witness will not want to let his actual assailant go unpunished merely to falsely implicate a third party for the commission of the offence. Thus, the deposition of the injured witness should be relied upon unless there are strong grounds for rejection of his evidence on the basis of major contradictions and discrepancies therein. 29. Ashfaq (PW.2) had given graphic description of the entire incident. His presence on the spot cannot be doubted as he was injured in the incident. His deposition must be given due weightage. His deposition also stood fully corroborated by the evidence of Anees (PW.1) and Usmal Ali (PW.4). The depositions so made cannot be brushed aside merely because there have been some trivial contradictions or omissions. Medical Evidence versus Ocular Evidence 30. In Ram Narain Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR 1975 SC 1727, this Court held that where the evidence of the witnesses for the prosecution is totally inconsistent with the medical evidence or the evidence of the ballistics expert, it amounts to a fundamental defect in the prosecution's case and unless reasonably explained it is sufficient to discredit the entire case. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126399/ 8 Abdul Sayeed vs State Of M.P on 14 September, 2010 31. In State of Haryana v. Bhagirath & Ors., (1999) 5 SCC 96, it was held as follows:- ""The opinion given by a medical witness need not be the last word on the subject. Such an opinion shall be tested by the court. If the opinion is bereft of logic or objectivity, the court is not obliged to go by that opinion. After all opinion is what is formed in the mind of a person regarding a fact situation. If one doctor forms one opinion and another doctor forms a different opinion on the same facts it is open to the Judge to adopt the view which is more objective or probable. Similarly if the opinion given by one doctor is not consistent with probability the court has no liability to go by that opinion merely because it is said by the doctor. Of course, due weight must be given to opinions given by persons who are experts in the particular subject."" [Emphasis added] 32. Drawing on Bhagirath's case (supra.), this Court has held that where the medical evidence is at variance with ocular evidence, it has to be noted that it would be erroneous to accord undue primacy to the hypothetical answers of medical witnesses to exclude the eyewitnesses' account which had to be tested independently and not treated as the ""variable"" keeping the medical evidence as the ""constant"". Where the eyewitnesses' account is found credible and trustworthy, a medical opinion pointing to alternative possibilities can not be accepted as conclusive. The eyewitnesses' account requires a careful independent assessment and evaluation for its credibility, which should not be adversely prejudged on the basis of any other evidence, including medical evidence, as the sole touchstone for the test of such credibility. The evidence must be tested for its inherent consistency and the inherent probability of the story; consistency with the account of other witnesses held to be creditworthy; consistency with the undisputed facts, the ""credit"" of the witnesses; their performance in the witness box; their power of observation etc. Then the probative value of such evidence becomes eligible to be put into the scales for a cumulative evaluation. (Vide Thaman Kumar v. State of Union Territory of Chandigarh, (2003) 6 SCC 380; and Krishnan v. State, (2003) 7 SCC 56). 33. In Solanki Chimanbhai Ukabhai v. State of Gujarat, AIR 1983 SC 484, this Court observed, ""Ordinarily, the value of medical evidence is only corroborative. It proves that the injuries could have been caused in the manner alleged and nothing more. The use which the defence can make of the medical evidence is to prove that the injuries could not possibly have been caused in the manner alleged and thereby discredit the eye-witnesses. Unless, however the medical evidence in its turn goes so far that it completely rules out all possibilities whatsoever of injuries taking place in the manner alleged by eyewitnesses, the testimony of the eye-witnesses cannot be thrown out on the ground of alleged inconsistency between it and the medical evidence."" [Emphasis added] 34. A similar view has been taken in Mani Ram & Ors. v. State of U.P., 1994 Supp (2) SCC 289; Khambam Raja Reddy & Anr. v. Public Prosecutor, High Court of A.P., (2006) 11 SCC 239; and State of U.P. v. Dinesh, (2009) 11 SCC 566. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126399/ 9 Abdul Sayeed vs State Of M.P on 14 September, 2010 35. In State of U.P. v. Hari Chand, (2009) 13 SCC 542, this Court re- iterated the aforementioned position of law and stated that, ""In any event unless the oral evidence is totally irreconcilable with the medical evidence, it has primacy."" 36. Thus, the position of law in cases where there is a contradiction between medical evidence and ocular evidence can be crystallised to the effect that though the ocular testimony of a witness has greater evidentiary value vis-`-vis medical evidence, when medical evidence makes the ocular testimony improbable, that becomes a relevant factor in the process of the evaluation of evidence. However, where the medical evidence goes so far that it completely rules out all possibility of the ocular evidence being true, the ocular evidence may be disbelieved. 37. In the instant case as referred to hereinabove, a very large number of assailants attacked one person, thus the witnesses cannot be able to state as how many injuries and in what manner the same had been caused by the accused. In such a fact-situation, discrepancy in medical evidence and ocular evidence is bound to occur. However, it cannot tilt the balance in favour of the appellants. 38. It has been canvassed on behalf of the appellants that there was no charge framed under Section 34 IPC by the trial Court and appellants and other co-accused have been charged under Section 147/148 IPC. All of them have been acquitted for the said charges. Thus, it was not permissible for the High Court to convict the appellants with the aid of Section 34 IPC. Non-framing of charge is fatal to the prosecution. Thus, the appellants are entitled for acquittal on this ground alone. Effect of Failure to frame proper charges 39. In State of Andhra Pradesh v. Thakkidiram Reddy & Ors., (1998) 6 SCC 554, this Court considered the issue of failure to frame the proper charges. observing as under: ""10. Sub-section (1) of Section 464 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 (`the Code', for short) expressly provides that no finding, sentence or order by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be deemed invalid merely on the ground that no charge was framed or on the ground of any error, omission or irregularity in the charge including any misjoinder of charges, unless in the opinion of the court of appeal, confirmation or revision, a failure of justice has in fact been occasioned thereby. Sub-section (2) of the said section lays down the procedure that the court of appeal, confirmation or revision has to follow in case it is of the opinion that a failure of justice has in fact been occasioned. The other section relevant for our purposes is Section 465 of the Code; and it lays down that no finding, sentence or order passed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered by a court of appeal, confirmation or revision on account of any error, omission or irregularity in the proceedings, unless in the opinion of that court, a failure of justice has in fact been occasioned. It further provides, inter alia, that in determining whether any error, omission or irregularity in any proceeding under this Code has occasioned a failure of justice, the Court shall have regard to the fact whether the objection could and should have been raised at an earlier stage in the proceedings."" Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126399/ 10 Abdul Sayeed vs State Of M.P on 14 September, 2010 The Court further held that in judging a question of prejudice, as of guilt, the court must look to the substance of the matter and not to technicalities, and its main concern should be to see whether the accused had a fair trial, whether he knew what he was being tried for, whether the main facts sought to be established against him were explained to him fairly and clearly and whether he was given a full and fair chance to defend himself. In the said case this Court ultimately came to the conclusion that despite the defect in the framing of charges, as no prejudice had been caused to the accused, no interference was required. 40. A Constitution Bench of this Court in Willie (William) Slaney v. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1956 SC 116, considered the issue of failure to frame charges properly and the conviction of an accused for the offences for which he has not been charged and reached the conclusion as under:- ""86. ... In such a situation, the absence of a charge under one or other of the various heads of criminal liability for the offence cannot be said to be fatal by itself, and before a conviction for the substantive offence, without a charge, can be set aside, prejudice will have to be made out. .... 87. ... If it is so grave that prejudice will necessarily be implied or imported, it may be described as an illegality. If the seriousness of the omission is of a lesser degree, it will be an irregularity and prejudice by way of failure of justice will have to be established."" 41. This Court in Gurpreet Singh v. State of Punjab, (2005) 12 SCC 615, referred to and relied upon its earlier judgments in Willie (William) Slaney (supra) and Thakkidiram Reddy (supra), and held that unless there is a failure of justice and thereby the cause of the accused has been prejudiced, no interference is required if the conviction can be upheld on the evidence led against the accused. The Court should not interfere unless it is established that the accused was in any way prejudiced due to the errors and omissions in framing the charges against him. A similar view has been re-iterated by this Court in Ramji Singh v. State of Bihar, (2001) 9 SCC 528; and Sanichar Sahni v. State of Bihar, (2009) 7 SCC 198. 42. There is no bar in law on conviction of the accused with the aid of Section 34 IPC in place of Section 149 IPC if there is evidence on record to show that such accused shared a common intention to commit the crime and no apparent injustice or prejudice is shown to have been caused by application of Section 34 IPC in place of Section 149 IPC. The absence of a charge under one or the other or the various heads of criminal liability for the offence cannot be said to be by itself prejudicial to the accused, and before a conviction for the substantive offence without a charge can be set aside, prejudice will have to be made out. Such a legal position is bound to be held good in view of the provisions of Sections 215, 216, 218, 221 and 464 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. (Vide: Dalip Singh & Ors. v. State of Punjab, AIR 1953 SC 364; Malhu Yadav & Ors. v. State of Bihar, (2002) 5 SCC 724; Dhaneswar Mahakud & Ors. v. State of Orissa, (2009) 9 SCC 307; and Annareddy Sambasiva Reddy & Ors. v. State of Andhra Pradesh, AIR 2009 SC 2661). Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126399/ 11 Abdul Sayeed vs State Of M.P on 14 September, 2010 43. Thus, the law on the issue can be summarised to the effect that unless the accused is able to establish that the defect(s) in framing the charge(s) has caused real prejudice to him; that he was not informed as to what was the real case against him; or that he could not defend himself properly, no interference is required on mere technicalities. 44. If the instant case is examined in the light of the aforesaid settled legal propositions we do not find any force in the submissions made on behalf of the appellants. Section 34 IPC 45. The aforesaid conclusion takes us to the issue raised by the appellants as to whether appellants could be convicted with the aid of Section 34 IPC. Section 34 IPC carves out an exception from general law that a person is responsible for his own act, as it provides that a person can also be held vicariously responsible for the act of others if he has the ""common intention"" to commit the offence. The phrase ""common intention"" implies a pre-arranged plan and acting in concert pursuant to the plan. Thus, the common intention must be there prior to the commission of the offence in point of time. The common intention to bring about a particular result may also well develop on the spot as between a number of persons, with reference to the facts of the case and circumstances existing thereto. The common intention under Section 34 IPC is to be understood in a different sense from the ""same intention"" or ""similar intention"" or ""common object"". The persons having similar intention which is not the result of the pre- arranged plan cannot be held guilty of the criminal act with the aid of Section 34 IPC. (See Mohan Singh & Anr. v. State of Punjab, AIR 1963 SC 174). 46. The establishment of an overt act is not a requirement of law to allow Section 34 to operate inasmuch this Section gets attracted when a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all. What has, therefore, to be established by the prosecution is that all the concerned persons had shared a common intention. (vide : Krishnan & Anr. v. State of Kerala, (1996) 10 SCC 508; and Harbans Kaur & Anr. v. State of Haryana, (2005) 9 SCC 195 ). Undoubtedly, the ingredients of Section 34, i.e., that the accused had acted in furtherance of their common intention is required to be proved specifically or by inference, in the facts and circumstances of the case. (Vide: Hamlet alias Sasi & Ors. v. State of Kerala, (2003) 10 SCC 108; Pichai alias Pichandi & Ors. v. State of Tamil Nadu, (2005) 10 SCC 505; and Bishna alias Bhiswadeb Mahato & Ors. v. State of West Bengal, (2005) 12 SCC 657). 47. In Gopi Nath @ Jhallar v. State of U.P., (2001) 6 SCC 620, this court observed as under: ""8.....Even the doing of separate, similar or diverse acts by several persons, so long as they are done in furtherance of a common intention, render each of such persons liable for the result of them all, as if he had done them himself, for the whole of the criminal action -- be it that it was not overt or was only a covert act or merely an omission constituting an illegal omission. The section, therefore, has been held to be Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126399/ 12 Abdul Sayeed vs State Of M.P on 14 September, 2010 attracted even where the acts committed by the different confederates are different when it is established in one way or the other that all of them participated and engaged themselves in furtherance of the common intention which might be of a pre- concerted or pre-arranged plan or one manifested or developed at the spur of the moment in the course of the commission of the offence. The common intention or the intention of the individual concerned in furtherance of the common intention could be proved either from direct evidence or by inference from the acts or attending circumstances of the case and conduct of the parties. The ultimate decision, at any rate, would invariably depend upon the inferences deducible from the circumstances of each case."" 48. In Krishnan and Anr. v. State represented by Inspector of Police, (2003) 7 SCC 56, this court observed that applicability of Section 34 is dependent on the facts and circumstances of each case. No hard and fast rule can be made out regarding applicability or non-applicability of Section 34. 49. In Girija Shankar v. State of U.P., (2004) 3 SCC 793, it is observed that Section 34 has been enacted to elucidate the principle of joint liability of a criminal act: ""Section 34 has been enacted on the principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The section is only a rule of evidence and does not create a substantive offence. The distinctive feature of the section is the element of participation in action. The liability of one person for an offence committed by another in the course of criminal act perpetrated by several persons arises under Section 34 if such criminal act is done in furtherance of a common intention of the persons who join in committing the crime. Direct proof of common intention is seldom available and, therefore, such intention can only be inferred from the circumstances appearing from the proved facts of the case and the proved circumstances."" [Emphasis added] (Emphasis added) 50. In Virendra Singh v. State of Madhya Pradesh, JT 2010 (8) SC 319, this Court observed that: ""Section 34 IPC does not create any distinct offence, but it lays down the principle of constructive liability. Section 34 IPC stipulates that the act must have been done in furtherance of the common intention. In order to incur joint liability for an offence there must be a pre- arranged and pre-meditated concert between the accused persons for doing the act actually done, though there might not be long interval between the act and the pre-meditation and though the plan may be formed suddenly. In order that section 34 IPC may apply, it is not necessary that the prosecution must prove that the act was done by a particular or a specified person. In fact, the section is intended to cover a case where a number of persons act together and on the facts of the case it is not possible for the prosecution to prove as to which of the persons who acted together actually committed the crime. Little or no distinction exists between a charge for an offence under a particular section and a charge under that section read with Section 34."" Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/126399/ 13 Abdul Sayeed vs State Of M.P on 14 September, 2010 51. Section 34 can be invoked even in those cases where some of the co- accused may be acquitted provided, it can be proved either by direct evidence or inference that the accused and the others have committed an offence in pursuance of the common intention of the group. (vide: Prabhu Babaji v. State of Bombay, AIR 1956 SC 51). 52. Section 34 intends to meet a case in which it is not possible to distinguish between the criminal acts of the individual members of a party, who act in furtherance of the common intention of all the members of the party or it is not possible to prove exactly what part was played by each of them. In the absence of common intention, the criminal liability of a member of the group might differ according to the mode of the individual's participation in the act. Common intention means that each member of the group is aware of the act to be committed. 53. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we are of the considered opinion that the High Court has rightly proceeded in the matter while setting aside the conviction of the appellants under Sections 147/148 IPC and convicting them with the aid of Section 34 IPC. Sum up: 54. In view of the above, it is evident that an FIR had been lodged promptly within 20 minutes from the time of commission of the offence as the place of occurrence was in close proximity of Police Chowki and all the appellants along with other co-accused had been named therein. There had been an injured witness. The prosecution has explained the motive that the appellants did not like intervention of Chand Khan taking side of Kamla Bai who had been molested by persons of the accused party. Several hours after the lodging of the complaint by Chand Khan in that incident, the appellants attacked Chand Khan with motive in a pre-planned manner armed with deadly weapons and caused injuries. Shabir Khan, son of Chand Khan when came to rescue his father was also done away with. In the incident, Ashfaq (PW.2) also got injured. The courts below after appreciating the evidence on record rightly came to the conclusion that the five appellants had been responsible for the said offences. The testimony of these witnesses had been subjected to searching cross-examination, but nothing has been brought on record to discredit the statement of either of the eye-witnesses. 55. In view of the above, we are of the view that the instant case does not present special features warranting review of the impugned judgment. Thus, there is no cogent reason to interfere with the impugned judgment and order dated 12.1.2006 passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh. The appeals lack merit and are accordingly dismissed. ...................................J. (P. SATHASIVAM) ................................J. (Dr. B.S.

THE APPEAL 1. This is an appeal, by special leave, by 4 (four) appellants. They call in question the judgment and order dated 04th May, 20111 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Punjab and Haryana2 dismissing a criminal appeal3 under section 374(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 19734. Such appeal was preferred by the appellants, arraigned as “A-1”, “A-2”, “A-3” and “A-4” in the trial, and a co-accused (“A-5”). The judgment of conviction and the impugned judgment, hereafter High Court, hereafter Criminal Appeal No. 454-DB of 2001 Cr. PC, hereafter 1 of 16 order of sentence dated 04th August, 2001, passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Punjab5 in a sessions case6 registered against A-1, A-2, A- 3, A-4 and A-5 was majorly upheld. While A-5 was acquitted, conviction of A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4 and the sentence imposed upon them were maintained by the High Court. The Trial Court convicted A-4 under sections 148, 302, 307 of the Indian Penal Code7 and section 27 of the Arms Act, while A-1, A-2 and A-3 as well as A-5 were convicted under sections 148, 302, 307 IPC read with section 34 IPC. All the accused were sentenced to life in prison. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181281271/ 1 Baljinder Singh @ Ladoo vs The State Of Punjab on 25 September, 2024 2. The appeal was heard in the presence of learned advocates for the parties on 09th May, 2024. It was submitted in course of such hearing that A-4 might have died during pendency of the appeal and that A-1 and A-3 were juveniles as on the date of the offence, i.e., 12th December, 1997. Learned advocate for the respondent - State of Punjab was directed to obtain appropriate instructions. He confirmed on 23rd July, 2024 that A-4 was indeed no more, having breathed his last on 16th February, 2019; hence, it was recorded by an order passed on that date that the appeal at the instance of A-4 stands abated. Insofar as the claim of juvenility raised by A-1 and A-3 is concerned, the same was overruled by an order passed by us on 23rd July, 2024 itself. BRIEF RESUME OF FACTS 3. The facts, leading to the present appeal, may be summarised as follows: Trial Court, hereafter IPC, hereafter 2 of 16 a) The prosecution case was set in motion when P.W.8 - Inspector Gurbhinder Singh/Investigating Officer, SHO, Police Station Sadar, Taran Tarn, upon receiving information on 12th December, 1997 from P.W.2 – Dr. Brij Mohan of the Civil Hospital, Taran Tarn - reached the hospital and recorded the statement of P.W. 3 – victim Puran Singh @ Bhola. P.W.3 recounted that on the morning of 12th December, 1997 around 9:00 AM, he was standing outside his residence near the chowk, when A-1, son of A-4, came riding a scooter from the direction of the gurudwara and bumped into P.W. 3, causing minor injuries to little and the ring fingers of P.W. 3’s right hand. In response, P.W. 3 slapped A-1, who in return hurled pejoratives at P.W. 3. Indignantly, P.W. 3 again slapped A-1. Upon hearing the commotion, P.W. 4 – victim Jit Singh, deceased victim Karam Singh8, deceased victim Laddi9 and P.W. 5 – victim Jagga @Jagjit Singh intervened and separated P.W. 3 and A-1. b) Within 15 minutes of such altercation, A-1, A-2 and A-3 (all sons of A-4), armed with dangs and sofas, accompanied by A-4 (who wielded a 12 bore double-barrel gun) and A-5 (armed with a dang) assembled on the street and while raising exhortations (lalkaras) attacked P.W. 3, P.W. 4, P.W. 5, and the deceased nos. 1 and 210. A-1, A-2 and A-3 began brick batting and A- 4, with an intention to kill, fired five shots at the victims, resulting in minor injury to P.W. 3 and serious injuries to P.W.4, P.W. 5 and the victims. deceased no.1, hereafter deceased no.2, hereafter victims, hereafter when referred to collectively 3 of 16 c) First Information Report11 was registered on 12th December, 1997 at about 12:45 PM, for the offences under sections 307 and 148, IPC read with section 149, IPC and section 25 and 27 of the Arms Act. Deceased no. 1 breathed his last on 13th December, 1997 and consequently offence under section 302, IPC was added to the said FIR. Deceased no.2 succumbed to the gunshot injury suffered by him on 10th January, 1998. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181281271/ 2 Baljinder Singh @ Ladoo vs The State Of Punjab on 25 September, 2024 d) Charges were framed against A-4 under sections 148, 302, IPC [on two (2) counts], sections 307 [on three (3) counts] and 324, IPC; and against A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-5 under sections 148, 302 read with 149 [on two (2) counts], 307 read with 149 [on three (3) counts] and 324 read with 149, IPC. e) The Trial Court vide judgment and order dated 04th August, 2001, after finding the appellants and A-5 guilty, convicted them for the offences and sentenced them as enumerated in paragraph 1 of this judgment. f) The outcome of the appeal carried from the aforesaid conviction and sentence has also been noticed above. SUBMISSIONS 4. The argument advanced by learned counsel for the appellants is primarily directed against what he contended to be an apparent error of judgment in convicting the appellants. According to him, the following points deserve deliberation: a) firstly, the High Court did not dwell upon the dissimilitude between common object and common intention, while transmuting appellants’ conviction FIR, hereafter 4 of 16 under section 302 IPC read with section 149 IPC to section 302 IPC read with section 34 IPC. b) secondly, the absence of brick bat injuries on the bodies of the P.W.3, P.W.4, P.W.5 and the victims, substantiate that A-1, A-2 and A-3 were not present at the crime scene. c) thirdly, in criminal cases, it is the propensity of a human being to undermine his role while exaggerating the role of the assailant. d) fourthly, Bir Singh, uncle of P.W.3, was inimical towards the appellants as an FIR was registered against his son by the daughter of A-4. e) fifthly, the case of exceeding the right of private defence can be made against A-4 for firing in retaliation; when he was chased and attacked by victims and no case against the other appellants has been made out. Names of A-1, A-2, and A-3 were included in the FIR with an intention to implicate all the members of the family. f) sixthly, the genesis of the entire crime, that is the injury caused on the fingers of P.W.3 by the collision between P.W.3 and A-1, was not found on the fingers of P.W.3; hence, deposition by P.W.3, P.W.4 and P.W.5 appears incredulous. g) finally, no independent witness has been examined, despite the crime scene, as enumerated by prosecution, being adjoined by several shops and residential houses. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181281271/ 3 Baljinder Singh @ Ladoo vs The State Of Punjab on 25 September, 2024 5. Learned counsel for the appellants, called into question “the legality of the impugned order”, on merits, by underlining inconsistencies in deposition(s) and has, therefore, prayed for the acquittal of the appellants by setting 5 of 16 aside the judgment of conviction and order of sentence passed by the Trial Court, as affirmed by the High Court. 6. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent, by denying the grounds taken by appellants in the instant appeal, supported the judgment of conviction and order of sentence passed by the Trial Court, which has been affirmed by the High Court. ANALYSIS 7. We have heard the parties and considered the evidence led by them before the Trial Court. We have also read the trial and appellate judgment and order. 8. The sole issue that we are tasked to decide is, whether the conviction of A- 1, A-2 and A-3 and the sentence imposed on them warrant interdiction. 9. Prosecution in order to substantiate its case adduced evidence, both ocular and documentary, before the Trial Court. The genesis of the crime is the collision of the scooter driven by A-1 with P.W.3, whereupon P.W.3 slapped A-1 followed by abuses hurled at P.W. 3 by A-1 and retaliation of P.W.3 by again slapping A-1. A-1 was 18 years of age while P.W. 3 was double his age. An elderly man slapping a young boy was considered credible by the High Court. This incident was witnessed by P.W.3, P.W.4, P.W.5 and the victims, who were already present on the spot; and, this has been proved by the unanimous and coherent ocular versions, as narrated by P.W.3, P.W.4 and P.W.5 in their depositions. 10. The learned counsel for the appellants, however, questioned the integrity of the genesis of the case by highlighting the absence of any reference to a 6 of 16 finger injury in the medical records of P.W.3. Additionally, the learned counsel for the appellants contended that during cross-examination, P.W.4 and P.W.5 had testified that blood was oozing from P.W.3's fingers. This argument aimed to challenge the reliability of the ocular testimonies of P.W.3, P.W.4, and P.W.5. 11. In the context of the case, it is pertinent to emphasize that the incident involving A-1’s scooter bumping into P.W.3, and the subsequent altercation in which P.W.3 slapped A-1, is of greater significance for establishing motive than the minor finger injury sustained by P.W.3. This sequence of events has been unequivocally testified to by P.W.3, P.W.4, and P.W.5. Furthermore, P.W.3 has testified that the injury to the finger was minor, which may account for the absence of any mention of this injury in P.W.3’s medical records. 12. Also, it is worth indicating that P.W.3, P.W.4, and P.W.5 are “injured witnesses” or “injured eye-witnesses” in this case. The sworn testimonies provided by injured witnesses generally carry significant evidentiary weight. Such testimonies cannot be dismissed as unreliable unless there are pellucid and substantial discrepancies or contradictions that undermine their credibility. If there is Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181281271/ 4 Baljinder Singh @ Ladoo vs The State Of Punjab on 25 September, 2024 any exaggeration in the deposition that is immaterial to the case, such exaggeration should be disregarded; however, it does not warrant the rejection of the entire evidence. Therefore, the suspicion raised by the appellants regarding the genesis of the case is rendered unfounded. 7 of 16 13. The abovementioned conclusion stands fortified with reference to paragraph 26 of the decision of this Court in Balu Sudam Khalde and Anr. vs. State of Maharashtra12. The relevant passage is reproduced as under: “26. When the evidence of an injured eye-witness is to be appreciated, the under-noted legal principles enunciated by the Courts are required to be kept in mind: (a) The presence of an injured eye-witness at the time and place of the occurrence cannot be doubted unless there are material contradictions in his deposition. (b) Unless, it is otherwise established by the evidence, it must be believed that an injured witness would not allow the real culprits to escape and falsely implicate the accused. (c) The evidence of injured witness has greater evidentiary value and unless compelling reasons exist, their statements are not to be discarded lightly. (d) The evidence of injured witness cannot be doubted on account of some embellishment in natural conduct or minor contradictions. (e) If there be any exaggeration or immaterial embellishments in the evidence of an injured witness, then such contradiction, exaggeration or embellishment should be discarded from the evidence of injured, but not the whole evidence. (f) The broad substratum of the prosecution version must be taken into consideration and discrepancies which normally creep due to loss of memory with passage of time should be discarded.” (emphasis supplied) 14. Furthermore, A-1 returned to the street within 15 minutes, accompanied by A-2, A-3, and A-4, all armed with various weapons, viz. a 12 bore double- barrel gun, dangs, and lathis. They launched an attack on the victims, wherein A-1, A-2, A-3 threw brick bats and A-4 opened fire at the victims. This account is corroborated by testimonies of P.W.3, P.W.4 and P.W.5, which also stood the test of cross-examination and no glaring discrepancies can be found. P.W.8 (I.O.) deposed that three (3) empties of 12 (twelve) bore double barrel gun were recovered from the crime spot, and the gun was 2023 SCC OnLine SC 355 8 of 16 recovered with 2 (two) live cartridges after the disclosure statement was made by A-4. Additionally, the serious/fatal Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181281271/ 5 Baljinder Singh @ Ladoo vs The State Of Punjab on 25 September, 2024 injuries sustained by the victims have been substantiated by medico-legal evidence provided by witnesses from the medical field, who have also testified under oath. The severe nature of the attack by A-4, assisted by A-1, A-2 and A-3, inflicting serious/fatal injuries upon the victims leads to the inference that the appellants came with an intention to kill in retaliation of a previous altercation. Hence, the prosecution version is indeed reliable. 15. Per contra, the learned counsel for the appellants contended that A-4 was alone at the time of the alleged offence. He asserted that A-4 used to read sehra in weddings and en route to the Sarpanch’s son’s wedding, where he was supposed to read sehra, he was ridiculed by P.W.3, P.W.4, P.W.5, and the victims for carrying what they claimed was a dummy gun. In response to the mockery, A-4 verbally retorted, which led to an attack on him with brickbats. According to the appellants, A-4 fired in self-defence during this confrontation. They further claim that A-4, along with A-1, A-2, and A-3, have been falsely implicated in this case as retaliation for an FIR filed by A- 4’s daughter against the son of Bir Singh, who is the uncle of P.W.1. However, P.W1, P.W.2 and P.W.3 in unison have deposed that they were oblivious of the case registered against the son of Bir Singh by the daughter of A-4. 16. While the depositions of D.W.1 and P.W.5 establish that A-4’s daughter filed an FIR against the son of Bir Singh and that A-4 was known for reading sehra at weddings, the burden of proving an assertion that A-4 was on his way to the Sarpanch’s son's wedding lay upon A-4, which would have been 9 of 16 more credibly substantiated by the testimony of the Sarpanch himself, as rightly noted in the High Court’s judgment. In the absence of testimonies from the Sarpanch and the daughter of A-4, the appellants' claim of being falsely implicated remains unsubstantiated and, therefore, deemed unreliable. 17. Regarding the question of common intention, capable of being formed within 15 minutes’, profitable reference may be made to paragraph 26 of the decision of this Court in Krishnamurthy alias Gunodu and Ors. vs. State of Karnataka13. Paragraph 26 being relevant is quoted hereunder: “26. Section 34 IPC makes a co-perpetrator, who had participated in the offence, equally liable on the principle of joint liability. For Section 34 to apply there should be common intention between the co-perpetrators, which means that there should be community of purpose and common design or prearranged plan. However, this does not mean that co- perpetrators should have engaged in any discussion, agreement or valuation. For Section 34 to apply, it is not necessary that the plan should be prearranged or hatched for a considerable time before the criminal act is performed. Common intention can be formed just a minute before the actual act happens. Common intention is necessarily a psychological fact as it requires prior meeting of minds. In such cases, direct evidence normally will not be available and in most cases, whether or not there exists a common intention has to be determined by drawing inference from the facts proved. This requires an inquiry into the antecedents, conduct of the co-participants or perpetrators at the time and after the occurrence. The manner in which the accused arrived, mounted the attack, nature and type of injuries inflicted, the weapon used, conduct or acts of the co- Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181281271/ 6 Baljinder Singh @ Ladoo vs The State Of Punjab on 25 September, 2024 assailants/perpetrators, object and purpose behind the occurrence or the attack, etc. are all relevant facts from which inference has to be drawn to arrive at a conclusion whether or not the ingredients of Section 34 IPC are satisfied. We must remember that Section 34 IPC comes into operation against the co-perpetrators because they have not committed the principal or main act, which is undertaken/performed or is attributed to the main culprit or perpetrator. Where an accused is the main or final perpetrator, resort to Section 34 IPC is not necessary as (2022) 7 SCC 521 10 of 16 the said perpetrator is himself individually liable for having caused the injury/offence. A person is liable for his own acts. Section 34 or the principle of common intention is invoked to implicate and fasten joint liability on other co-participants.” (emphasis supplied) 18. Section 34, IPC underlines that when a criminal act is done by two or more persons in furtherance of common intention, each of them is liable for the act done as if it were done by him alone. 19. We are of the view that there cannot be a fixed timeframe for formation of common intention. It is not essential for the perpetrators to have had prior meetings to conspire or make preparations for the crime. Common intention to commit murder can arise even moments before the commission of the act. Since common intention is a mental state of the perpetrators, it is inherently challenging to substantiate directly. Instead, it can be inferred from the conduct of the perpetrators immediately before, during, and after the commission of the act. 20. In the present case, the appellants, who are related by blood, arrived at the crime scene armed with a 12 bore double-barrel gun, dangs, and lathis within 15 minutes of the initial altercation, and subsequently attacked P.W.3, P.W.4, P.W.5, and the victims. During this attack, A-4, the father of A-1, raged by the incident of P.W.3 slapping his adult son A-1 and the pursuant altercation, fired with his gun at P.W.3, P.W.4, P.W.5 and the victims. Thereafter, all the appellants fled together carrying their weapons. In view of such conduct of the appellants as mentioned above and in the light of interpretation of Section 34, IPC in Krishnamurthy alias Gunodu (supra), it is evident that the appellants acted with a common intention to kill, seeking to avenge the slapping incident. 11 of 16 21. Be that as it may, the determination of common intention or common object should primarily be within the domain of the trial courts, and at the most the high courts. It should not be the role of this Court to directly adjudicate issues of common intention and common object. This Court has, in a catena of decisions, elaborated on the differences between section 149 and section 34, IPC; the overlapping nature of section 149 and section 34, IPC; and when can the offence under section 302 read with section 149, IPC be changed to section 302 read with section 34, IPC. Such decisions do provide suitable guidance for the lower courts to draw from, to reach their conclusions. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181281271/ 7 Baljinder Singh @ Ladoo vs The State Of Punjab on 25 September, 2024 22. In this connection, we may refer to paragraph 14 of the decision of this Court in Chittarmal vs. State of Rajasthan14. The relevant excerpt from such decision reads: “14. It is well settled by a catena of decisions that Section 34 as well as Section 149 deal with liability for constructive criminality i.e. vicarious liability of a person for acts of others. Both the sections deal with combinations of persons who become punishable as sharers in an offence. Thus, they have a certain resemblance and may to some extent overlap. But a clear distinction is made out between common intention and common object in that common intention denotes action concert and necessarily postulates the existence of a prearranged plan implying a prior meeting of the minds, while common object does not necessarily require proof of prior meeting of minds or preconcert. Though there is a substantial difference between the two sections, they also to some extent overlap and it is a question to be determined on the facts of each case whether the charge under Section 149 overlaps the ground covered by Section 34. Thus, if several persons numbering five or more, do an act and intend to do it, both Section 34 and Section 149 may apply. If the common object does not necessarily involve a common intention, then the substitution of Section 34 for Section 149 might result in prejudice to the accused and ought not, therefore, to be (2003) 2 SCC 266 12 of 16 permitted. But if it does involve a common intention then the substitution of Section 34 for Section 149 must be held to be a formal matter. Whether such recourse can be had or not must depend on the facts of each case. The non-applicability of Section 149 is, therefore, no bar in convicting the appellants under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC, if the evidence discloses commission of an offence in furtherance of the common intention of them all. [See Barendra Kumar Ghosh v. King Emperor, AIR 1925 PC 1, Mannam Venkatadari v. State of A.P., (1971) 3 SCC 254, Nethala Pothuraju v. State of Α.Ρ., (1992) 1 SCC 49, Ram Tahal v. State of U.P., (1972) 1 SCC 136].” (emphasis supplied) 23. In paragraph 17 of the decision of this Court in Chandra Pratap Singh vs. State of M.P.15, while dealing with conversion of charge from section 302 read with section 149, IPC to section 302 read with section 34 thereof, the above passage has been quoted with approval. 24. It would be relevant at this juncture to consider section 464 of the Cr. PC. On its plain terms, sub-section (1) of section 464 clearly indicates that no finding, sentence or order by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be deemed invalid merely on the ground that no charge was framed or on the ground of any error, omission or irregularity in the charge including any misjoinder of charges, unless, in an appeal, confirmation or revision, a claim of ""failure of justice"" has been substantiated. 25. Law is well-settled that in order to judge whether a failure of justice has been occasioned, it will be relevant to examine whether the accused was aware of the basic ingredients of the offence for Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181281271/ 8 Baljinder Singh @ Ladoo vs The State Of Punjab on 25 September, 2024 which he is being convicted and whether the main facts sought to be established against him were explained to him clearly and whether he got a fair chance to defend himself. (2023) 10 SCC 181 13 of 16 Reference in this connection may be made to the decision in Dalbir Singh vs. State of Uttar Pradesh16. 26. Also, it is beyond any cavil of doubt that the burden to show that in fact a failure of justice has been occasioned is on the accused. The decision in State of Uttar Pradesh vs. Paras Nath Singh17 can profitably be referred to in this regard. 27. We have no hesitation to hold that based on the above parameters, the appellants have fairly and squarely failed in their pursuit to demonstrate any failure of justice, which would impel us to exercise power of the nature contemplated in sub-section (2) of section 464, Cr. PC. We, therefore, see no reason to uphold the contention advanced on behalf of the appellants to the contrary. 28. Next, in order to impeach the oral evidence of P.W.3, P.W.4 and P.W.5, the appellants asserted that there is no testimony of any independent witness, despite the place of crime as per the case of prosecution being surrounded by shops and residential houses. 29. It is also settled law that examination of independent witness is not an indispensable requisite if the testimonies of other witnesses are deemed trustworthy and reliable. Non-examination of any independent witness by the prosecution will not go to the root of the matter affecting the decision of the court, unless other witnesses’ testimonies and evidences are scant to establish the guilt of the accused. Reference is made to paragraph 24 of the (2004) 5 SCC 334 (2009) 6 SCC 372 14 of 16 decision of this court in Guru Dutt Pathak vs. State of U.P.18, where it was ruled as follows: “24. One another ground given by the learned trial court while acquitting the accused was that no independent witness has been examined. The High Court has rightly observed that where there is clinching evidence of eyewitnesses, mere non- examination of some of the witnesses/independent witnesses and/or in absence of examination of any independent witnesses would not be fatal to the case of the prosecution. 24.1. In Manjit Singh vs. State of Punjab19, it is observed and held by this Court that reliable evidence of injured eyewitnesses cannot be discarded merely for reason that no independent witness was examined. 24.2. In the recent decision in Surinder Kumar vs. State of Punjab20, it is observed and held by this Court that merely because prosecution did not examine any independent witness, would not necessarily lead to conclusion that the accused was falsely implicated. 24.3. In Rizwan Khan vs. State of Chhattisgarh21, after referring to the decision of this Court in State of H.P. vs. Pardeep Kumar22, it is observed and held by this Court that the examination of the independent witnesses is not an indispensable requirement and such non-examination is not necessarily fatal to the prosecution case.” (emphasis supplied) Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/181281271/ 9 Baljinder Singh @ Ladoo vs The State Of Punjab on 25 September, 2024 30. It has been rightly pointed out by the Trial Court that the prosecution’s case is not that people from the surrounding locality gathered at the time of the incident. In the light of the aforenoted decisions of this Court and upon careful examination of the testimonies of P.W.3, P.W.4, and P.W.5, along with the relevant other evidence on record, the prosecution's case cannot be dismissed solely on the ground of the absence of independent witness. (2021) 6 SCC 116 (2019) 8 SCC 529 (2020) 2 SCC 563 (2020) 9 SCC 627 (2018) 13 SCC 808 15 of 16 31. Having regard to the foregoing discussion, the High Court's decision finding A-1, A-2, and A-3 guilty of offences under sections 148, 302, and 307, IPC read with section 34 thereof is affirmed as correct and upheld. 32. The sole issue is, thus, answered in the negative. CONCLUSION 33. The appeal is bereft of any merit and, therefore, stands dismissed. ……………………….…………….. J. (DIPANKAR DATTA) …………………………….……….. J.

Lodha Bench: R. M. Lodha, R.V. Raveendran REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO. 3933 OF 2010 (Arising out of SLP(C) No. 14428 of 2009) The Administrator, Union Territory of Dadra & Nagar Haveli ...Appellant Versus Gulabhia M. Lad ...Respondent JUDGEMENT R.M. Lodha, J. Leave granted. 2. The question that calls to be determined in this appeal by special leave is : on consideration of the report of the Inquiring Authority wherein misconduct of the respondent has been proved and after following the prescribed procedure, the Disciplinary Authority ordered his removal from service and the departmental appeal against that order has been dismissed by the Appellate Authority, whether Central Administrative Tribunal was justified, on the facts found, in interfering with the order of punishment on the ground that co-delinquents were awarded lesser punishment in departmental appeals and directing the appellant to reconsider the whole matter and give the respondent the same treatment which has been meted out to the co-delinquents. 3. Gulabhia M. Lad - respondent - while functioning as Land Reforms Officer--I , Dadra and Nagar Haveli for the period October 14, 1997 to April 27, 1998 allegedly granted occupancy rights of the government land situate at village Athola to five persons with ulterior motive by getting the survey conducted from R.K. Kapdi, Surveyor and without following the procedure prescribed under the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35507890/ 1 Admin.Union Territory Of D.&N.Haveli vs Gulabhia M.Lad on 28 April, 2010 Dadra and Nagar Haveli Land Reforms Regulation, 1971 (for short, `Regulations'). A disciplinary enquiry was initiated against him under Rule 14 of Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965. He was charged for misconduct under Rule 3 of Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964. Two other employees, R.K. Kapdi, Surveyor and P.N. Vinod, Patel Talati were also subjected to disciplinary enquiry in connection with illegal grant of occupancy rights of government land to those five persons. R.K. Kapdi was charged for having connived with the respondent and prepared a map by not following the procedure and without verifying the documentary evidence as required under the Regulations and in assigning new plot numbers without any authority in flagrant violation of law. Insofar as P.N. Vinod was concerned, he was charged for having connived with the respondent and prepared the statement on oath of each of the applicants in his own handwriting in the absence of the applicants and thereby abusing his official position as Patel Talati. 4. A joint enquiry was conducted against the respondent and two other delinquents, namely, R.K. Kapdi and P.N. Vinod. The three delinquents submitted their defence separately and denied any misconduct on their part. The Inquiring Authority, on consideration of the written statement of defence; evidence produced in the course of the inquiry and after hearing the Presenting Officer and the delinquents recorded its opinion that charges were proved and submitted its report to the Disciplinary Authority. The Disciplinary Authority (Administrator, Daman & Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli) served enquiry report upon respondent and after calling for explanation, imposed a major penalty of his removal from service vide order dated April 23, 2004. For the other two delinquents, the Disciplinary Authority was the Commissioner/Secretary (Finance), Daman & Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli and the said Disciplinary Authority after serving the enquiry report and calling for their explanation, ordered their removal from service by two separate orders. 5. The respondent filed the departmental appeal against the order of punishment dated April 23, 2004 before the Appellate Authority but the said appeal was dismissed on March 8, 2006. Insofar as the other two delinquents are concerned, their departmental appeals were partly allowed. The punishment of removal awarded to R.K. Kapdi was modified to that of compulsory retirement with effect from April 23, 2004 by the Appellate Authority while the punishment awarded to P.N. Vinod was modified to reduction to lower stage of pay by five stages with cumulative effect. 6. The order of punishment dated April 23, 2004 which was confirmed in departmental appeal by the Appellate Authority vide order dated March 8, 2006 came to be challenged by the respondent before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Bombay Bench at Mumbai (for short, `Tribunal') on diverse grounds. The Tribunal accepted the argument of the respondent that he has been discriminated in the matter of imposition of punishment. The Tribunal vide its order dated June 22, 2007 allowed the original application and held that similarly placed persons have been treated differently and the action of the present appellant in awarding differential punishment to the respondent by singling him out for the extreme punishment of removal could not be sustained. In this regard, the Tribunal relied upon two decisions of this Court, namely, (1) Tata Engineering & Locomotive Co. Ltd. v. Jitendra Pd. Singh and Another1 and (2) State of U.P. and Others. v. Raj Pal Singh2. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35507890/ 2 Admin.Union Territory Of D.&N.Haveli vs Gulabhia M.Lad on 28 April, 2010 7. The present appellant challenged the order of the Tribunal before Bombay High Court by filing a writ petition but (2001) 10 SCC 530 JT 2001 (Suppl. 1) SC 44 that was dismissed on December 1, 2008. The High Court held that as the authorities did not challenge the orders passed by the Appellate Authority in respect of co-delinquents, the order of the Tribunal did not call for any interference. 8. The scope of judicial review in disciplinary matters has come up for consideration before this Court time and again. It is worthwhile to refer to some of these decisions. In the case of B.C. Chaturvedi v. Union of India and Others3 this Court held: ""18. A review of the above legal position would establish that the disciplinary authority, and on appeal the appellate authority, being fact-finding authorities have exclusive power to consider the evidence with a view to maintain discipline. They are invested with the discretion to impose appropriate punishment keeping in view the magnitude or gravity of the misconduct. The High Court/Tribunal, while exercising the power of judicial review, cannot normally substitute its own conclusion on penalty and impose some other penalty. If the punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority or the appellate authority shocks the conscience of the High Court/Tribunal, it would appropriately mould the relief, either directing the disciplinary/appellate authority to reconsider the penalty imposed, or to shorten the litigation, it may itself, in exceptional and rare cases, impose appropriate punishment with cogent reasons in support thereof"". 9. In Director General, RPF and Others v. Ch. Sai Babu 4, this Court stated the legal position thus : (1995) 6 SCC 749 (2003) 4 SCC 331 ""6. ....Normally, the punishment imposed by a disciplinary authority should not be disturbed by the High Court or a tribunal except in appropriate cases that too only after reaching a conclusion that the punishment imposed is grossly or shockingly disproportionate, after examining all the relevant factors including the nature of charges proved against, the past conduct, penalty imposed earlier, the nature of duties assigned having due regard to their sensitiveness, exactness expected of and discipline required to be maintained, and the department/establishment in which the delinquent person concerned works."" 10. In the case of Chairman and Managing Director, United Commercial Bank and Others v. P.C. Kakkar5, this Court on review of long line of cases and the principles of judicial review of administrative action under English law summarized the legal position in the following words : ""11. The common thread running through in all these decisions is that the court should not interfere with the administrator's decision unless it was illogical or suffers from procedural impropriety or was shocking to the conscience of the court, in the sense that it was in defiance of logic or moral standards. In view of what has been stated in Wednesbury case [(1947) 2 All ER 680 (CA)] the court would not go into the correctness of the choice made by the administrator open to him and the court should not substitute its decision to that of the administrator. The scope of judicial review is limited Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35507890/ 3 Admin.Union Territory Of D.&N.Haveli vs Gulabhia M.Lad on 28 April, 2010 to the deficiency in decision-making process and not the decision. 12. To put it differently, unless the punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority or the Appellate Authority shocks the conscience of the court/tribunal, there is no (2003) 4 SCC364 scope for interference. Further, to shorten litigation it may, in exceptional and rare cases, impose appropriate punishment by recording cogent reasons in support thereof. In the normal course if the punishment imposed is shockingly disproportionate it would be appropriate to direct the disciplinary authority or the Appellate Authority to reconsider the penalty imposed. 13. In the case at hand the High Court did not record any reason as to how and why it found the punishment shockingly disproportionate. Even there is no discussion on this aspect. The only discernible reason was the punishment awarded in M.L. Keshwani case. As was observed by this Court in Balbir Chand v. Food Corpn. of India Ltd. [(1997) 3SCC 371] even if a co-delinquent is given lesser punishment it cannot be a ground for interference. Even such a plea was not available to be given credence as the allegations were contextually different"". 11. In Union of India and Another v. S.S. Ahluwalia6, this Court reiterated the legal position as follows : ""8. .......The scope of judicial review in the matter of imposition of penalty as a result of disciplinary proceedings is very limited. The court can interfere with the punishment only if it finds the same to be shockingly disproportionate to the charges found to be proved....."". 12. In State of Meghalaya and Others v. Mecken Singh N. Marak7 this Court stated : ""14. In the matter of imposition of sentence, the scope for interference is very limited and restricted to exceptional cases. The jurisdiction of the High Court, to interfere with the quantum of punishment is limited and cannot be exercised without sufficient reasons. The High Court, although has jurisdiction in appropriate case, to consider the question in regard to the quantum of punishment, but it has a limited role to play. It is now well settled that the High Courts, in exercise of powers under Article 226, do not interfere with the quantum of (2007) 7 SCC 257 (2008) 7 SCC 580 punishment unless there exist sufficient reasons therefor. The punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority or the appellate authority unless shocking to the conscience of the court, cannot be subjected to judicial review. In the impugned order of the High Court no reasons whatsoever have been indicated as to why the punishment was considered disproportionate. Failure to give reasons amounts to denial of justice. The mere statement that it is disproportionate would not suffice."" 13. The legal position is fairly well settled that while exercising power of judicial review, the High Court or a Tribunal cannot interfere with the discretion exercised by the Disciplinary Authority, Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35507890/ 4 Admin.Union Territory Of D.&N.Haveli vs Gulabhia M.Lad on 28 April, 2010 and/or on appeal the Appellate Authority with regard to the imposition of punishment unless such discretion suffers from illegality or material procedural irregularity or that would shock the conscience of the Court/Tribunal. The exercise of discretion in imposition of punishment by the Disciplinary Authority or Appellate Authority is dependent on host of factors such as gravity of misconduct, past conduct, the nature of duties assigned to the delinquent, responsibility of the position that the delinquent holds, previous penalty, if any, and the discipline required to be maintained in the department or establishment he works. Ordinarily the Court or a Tribunal would not substitute its opinion on reappraisal of facts. In a matter of imposition of punishment where joint disciplinary enquiry is held against more than one delinquent, the same or similarity of charges is not decisive but many factors as noticed above may be vital in decision making. A single distinguishing feature in the nature of duties or degree of responsibility may make difference insofar as award of punishment is concerned. To avoid multiplicity of proceedings and overlapping adducing of evidence, a joint enquiry may be conducted against all the delinquent officers but imposition of different punishment on proved charges may not be impermissible if the responsibilities and duties of the co-delinquents differ or where distinguishing features exist. In such a case, there would not be any question of selective or invidious discrimination. Does the present case make out discrimination in inflicting punishment? We do not think so. In the first place, the respondent and the two other delinquents may have been found guilty in connection with the same incident, i.e. illegal grant of occupancy rights in respect of government land to five persons but the charges against the respondent and the other two delinquents cannot be said to be same or substantially similar. The substance of the charge against the respondent was that as a Land Reforms Officer-I, he granted occupancy rights to the government land to five persons with ulterior motive by getting the survey conducted from co-delinquent R.K. Kapdi, Surveyor and without following the procedure prescribed under the Regulations. On the other hand, the main charge against R.K. Kapdi was that he prepared a map by not following the procedure and without verifying the documentary evidence as was required under the Regulations and assigning new plot numbers without any authority in flagrant violation of law. As regards, P.N. Vinod, he was principally charged for having prepared the statement on oath of each of the applicants in his own handwriting in the absence of the applicants and thereby abusing his official position as Patel Talati. Thus, there was variation in allegations of misconduct and all the three delinquents could not have been put on par although joint enquiry was held and there was common evidence. 14. Secondly, the Tribunal failed to notice that respondent was holding an important position as Land Reforms Officer during the relevant period having been conferred with various powers and duties under the Regulations. As a Land Reforms Officer, the respondent possessed the official authority for grant of occupancy rights under the Regulations. The co- delinquents were only his subordinates and they carried out his instructions. In the facts and circumstances, therefore, the respondent and the two co-delinquents cannot be said to have been similarly placed. 15. Thirdly, and more importantly, the Tribunal overlooked a very important aspect that even the Appellate Authority has not treated the case of co-delinquents viz., R.K. Kapdi and P.N. Vinod alike inasmuch as in the departmental appeal the punishment of removal awarded to R.K. Kapdi was modified to that of compulsory retirement while the punishment awarded to P.N. Vinod was modified to reduction to lower stage of pay by five stages with cumulative effect. There was, thus, no Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35507890/ 5 Admin.Union Territory Of D.&N.Haveli vs Gulabhia M.Lad on 28 April, 2010 similarity in award of punishment to the other two co- delinquents as well. 16. The Tribunal relied upon two decisions of this Court. In Tata Engineering & Locomotive Co. Ltd.1, this Court found no justification to interfere with the order of the High Court that recorded the following finding: ""Since as many as three workmen on almost identical charges were found guilty of misconduct in connection with the same incident, though in separate proceedings, and one was punished with only one month's suspension, and the other was ultimately reinstated in view of the findings recorded by the Labour Court and affirmed by the High Court and the Supreme Court, it would be denial of justice to the appellant if he alone is singled out for punishment by way of dismissal from service."" We are afraid Tata Engineering & Locomotive Co. Ltd.1 has no application to the facts of the present case. 17. Similarly, the decision of this Court in Raj Pal Singh2 has no application to the present case. It was found therein that the charges proved against the delinquents were same and identical. No dissimilarity was found and, therefore, it was held that it was not open for the Disciplinary Authority to impose different punishments for different delinquents. In the case in hand, we have already noticed above that the charges against respondent and co-delinquents were not exactly identical or substantially similar. Moreover, the respondent being the Land Reforms Officer was the authorized officer under the Regulations for grant of occupancy rights and for illegal grant of occupancy rights in respect of government lands, it was he who was squarely responsible. We have no hesitation in holding that on the facts found and conclusions recorded in the enquiry report, the punishment of removal cannot be said to be not commensurate with the misconduct proved against the respondent and the High Court ought to have interfered with the order of the Tribunal. 18. The result is that appeal is allowed, the order of the High Court dated December 1, 2008 and that of the Tribunal dated June 22, 2007 are set aside. The parties shall bear their own costs. ..................................J. (R.V. Raveendran) .....................................J (R. M. Lodha) New Delhi April 28, 2010.

The Appellant-Company claims to be a private limited company duly incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, which is engaged in manufacturing and exporting of cosmetics and toilet preparations and having one of its units in KASEZ. As per the Appellant-Company, its products get cleared from the KASEZ Unit into the Domestic Tariff Area (hereinafter referred to as “DTA”) in consonance with the necessary permissions granted to it by the appropriate authority. It is its case that it had effected the following three kinds of clearances from its KASEZ Unit into the DTA, being (a) Clearances of goods weighing or containing less than 20 gram or 20 millilitre, (b) products containing alcohol, and (c) other goods in “Wholesale Packs”. 5. From August 2004 onwards, Officers of the Kandla Customs (hereinafter referred as “Revenue Authorities”) moved against the Appellant-Company, alleging that they had escaped payment of CVD on the aforementioned clearances on account of non-disclosure of MRP as per the provisions of the Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1976 (hereinafter referred to as “SWM Act 1976”) as they had declared only the invoice value of the said goods. This was a violation of the proviso to Section 3(2) of the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 (hereinafter referred to as “CT Act 1975”) read with Section 4A(2) of the Central Excise Act, 1944 (hereinafter referred to as “CE Act 1944”), and on the said ground, goods being cleared by the Appellant-Company into the DTA were intercepted. The Revenue Authorities issued Show Cause Notices dated 03.11.2004, 10.11.2004, and 10.02.2005 (along with Corrigendum dated 11.03.2005) under Section 28 of the Customs Act, 1962 (hereinafter referred to as “CA 1962”), under Section 11A of the CE Act 1944, and under Section 124 of CA 1962 respectively. 6. Thereafter, pursuant to the said allegation based on source information to Respondent- Agency, First Information Report bearing number RC-6(A)/2005-GNR under Section 120B read with Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as “IPC 1860”) and Section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1998 (hereinafter referred to as “PCA 1998”) was registered on 04.04.2005 at Gandhinagar branch of Respondent-Agency (hereinafter referred to as “the FIR”). A raid is also claimed to have been conducted on the KASEZ Unit of the Appellant-Company by the Respondent-Agency. 7. Eventually, Assessment Orders were passed observing the non-declaration of MRP on the concerned goods by the Appellant-Company. These Assessment Orders were assailed by the Appellant-Company before the Commissioner of Customs (Appeals), Kandla by filing of appeals, which resulted in the passing of Orders dated 09.05.2005 and 30.06.2005. The Commissioner of Customs (Appeals), Kandla observed that the concerned goods were ought to be assessed under Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120309590/ 2 Baccarose Perfumes And Beauty Products ... vs Central Bureau Of Investigation on 6 September, 2024 Section 3(2) of the CT Act 1975 as opposed to the proviso to the said provision. Furthermore, declaration of MRP is necessary on packages intended for retail sale and not for bigger packages for wholesale trade. The Revenue Authorities were directed to consider the case of the concerned goods of the Appellant-Company afresh in light of the observations made in the said Orders. 8. In the meanwhile, a clarification was sought from the Office of the Collector of Legal Metrology and Director of Consumer Affairs by the Appellant-Company in the said regard and it was responded vide Letter dated 04.01.2006 wherein, the view taken by the Appellant- Company by placing reliance on Rule 29 of the Standards of Weights and Measures (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as “Packaged Commodities Rules 1977”) was affirmed. 9. Placing reliance on the Letter dated 04.01.2006 and other materials on record, the Appellant- Company moved three applications before the Settlement Commission and immunity was granted to it under the CE Act 1944, CA 1962, and IPC 1860 vide Common Order No. 248/Final Order/CEX/KNA/2007 dated 21.08.2007. 10. The Investigation Officer, thereafter, was pleased to move a Closure Report dated 05.03.2008 before the learned Special Judge. The Court, however, rejected the said Closure Report vide order dated 01.06.2010, and instead directed for registration of a Special Case against the accused persons, including the Appellant-Company. This case came to be registered as CBI Special Case No. 48 of 2010. 11. The Appellant-Company moved the High Court of Gujarat by filing a Special Criminal Application challenging the above Order which was dismissed on 12.12.2011. Aggrieved, the Appellant-Company moved this Court through filing of Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 14430 of 2013. This Court was pleased to condone the delay in filing, but while dismissing the petition vide Order dated 26.07.2013 observed that only cognizance had been taken by the learned Special Judge and directed issuance of summons to the Appellant-Company, and thereby, it was not an appropriate stage to interfere. However, liberty was granted to the Appellant-Company to pursue and plead for discharge at the time of hearing of charges. 12. In pursuance of the said liberty, the Appellant- Company moved an application for discharge before the learned Special Judge. One of the grounds was that the Appellant-Company had been granted immunity under the CE Act 1944, CA 1962, and IPC 1860 through Order dated 20.08.2007 passed by the competent authority, i.e., the Settlement Commission and pressed into service the observations made by this Court in General Officer Commanding, Rashtriya Rifles v. CBI1 and Another, Jamuna Singh and Others v. Bhadai Shah2, and Devarapalli Lakshminarayana Reddy and Others v. V. Narayana Reddy and Others3 to the effect that mere filing of FIR with the police, which is subsequently forwarded to the Court, does not amount to institution of prosecution. Furthermore, that the Appellant- Company is not a “public servant” vis-à-vis Section 13(1)(b) read with Section 13(2) of the PCA 1998. Besides this, the Court had already refused to accept contentions of the Respondent-Agency against Shri Yogendra Garg for sanction under Section 197 of the CrPC 1973, and henceforth, the Appellant- Company cannot be Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120309590/ 3 Baccarose Perfumes And Beauty Products ... vs Central Bureau Of Investigation on 6 September, 2024 prosecuted alone for the charge under Section 120B of IPC 1860, and it finally put forth that the offences under Section 1 (2012) 6 SCC 228 2 1963 SCC OnLine SC 263 3 (1976) 3 SCC 252 420 read with Section 120B of IPC 1860 are not made out as against the Appellant. 13. The learned Special Judge, however, disagreed Company and dismissed the said application vide Order dated 19.07.2017. To substantiate its dismissal, the Court with reference to the CE Act 1944, observed that as per Section 4A(1), it transpires that the retail price of the concerned goods is to be declared, which through reliance on Circular dated 01.03.2001 and the concerned provisions of law, is interpreted as declaration of MRP. 14. It is against the said Order dated 19.07.2017 that the Appellant-Company had moved the High Court of Gujarat in CRA No. 783 of 2017 which eventually led to the passing of the Impugned Order dated 15.09.2023. During the pendency of the CRA No. 783 of 2017, the High Court of Gujarat stayed further proceedings before the Special Judge while issuing notice to the Respondent-Agency vide Order dated 18.08.2017. It was brought to the attention of the High Court that the Appellant-Company had paid a total of INR 1,51,45,378/- (Rupees One Crore Fifty One Lakhs Forty Five Thousand Three Hundred and Seventy Eight only) during the investigation by the Revenue Authorities and admittedly, in light of the Orders dated 09.05.2005 and 30.06.2005, the Appellant-Company had become entitled to a refund instead. 15. While passing the Impugned Order dated 15.09.2023, the High Court of Gujarat disagreed with the contentions of the Appellant-Company, and affirmed the contentions of the Respondent-Agency. 16. It is in this backdrop that the Appellant- Company moved this Court in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 13422 of 2023 by reiterating its earlier contentions. On the first date of hearing, our attention was drawn to the Order dated 09.05.2005 of the Office of Commissioner of Customs (Appeals) which had directed that the matter be remanded to the assessing authority for fresh assessment. No further development is there in the case of the Appellant-Company. Accordingly, vide Order dated 16.10.2023, proceedings before the Trial Court were stayed. The Respondent-Agency, too, filed their contentions as part of its Counter Affidavit dated 19.04.2024. 17. Having heard the counsels for both the parties at length, it is pertinent to consider the concerned provisions of law before we delve into the legal and factual facet. 18. Predominantly, the argument of the Appellant- Company pertained to having been granted immunity by Settlement Commission vide Order dated 20.08.2007 as per Section 32K of the CE Act 1944. A perusal of the powers of the Settlement Commission leads us to equivalent provision under the CA 1962 through Section 127H. Both the provisions are pari materia to each other and bear the same text. These sections provide for an explicit bar from prosecution on grant of immunity in cases where the proceedings for any offence have been instituted subsequent to the date of receipt of the application seeking such immunity Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120309590/ 4 Baccarose Perfumes And Beauty Products ... vs Central Bureau Of Investigation on 6 September, 2024 under the relevant law. 19. A perusal of the scheme of the CrPC 1973 allows us to infer that mere registration of FIR cannot be interpreted to mean that it constitutes the initiation of such proceedings. A registration of FIR necessitates an investigation by a competent officer as per the detailed process outlined in Sections 155 to 176. It is only after a Final Report (or as referred in the common parlance, a Challan or a Chargesheet) is submitted as per the compliance of Section 173(2) of CrPC 1973, cognizance for the offence(s) concerned is taken. However, undoubtedly, the Court is not bound by the said report. The cardinal principle that investigation and taking of cognizance operate in parallel channels, without an intermingling, and in different areas was also laid down by this Court in H.N. Rishbud v. State (Delhi Admn.)4 and 4 (1954) 2 SCC 934 further elaborated and reiterated in Abhinandan Jha and Others v. Dinesh Mishra5 and State of Orissa v. Habibullah Khan6. 20. In Hira Lal Hari Lal Bhagwati v. CBI, New Delhi7, even though the subject matter of the dispute pertained to Kar Vivad Samadhan Scheme, 1998 (hereinafter referred to as “KVSS 1998”), the observations of this Court came to the rescue of the Assessee-Company therein. As per the said factual matrix, the case of the Assessee-Company therein was settled under the KVSS 1998 on 10.02.1999 by the Designated Authority and as per the terms of the settlement, the Assessee-Company therein withdrew the appeal before this Court on 16.03.1999 and a certificate for full and final settlement was issued on 19.07.1999. Despite that, on 06.01.1999, a case was registered as against the Appellant therein in capacity as the office bearer of the Assessee-Company. It was 5 1967 SCC OnLine SC 107 6 2003 SCC OnLine SC 1411 7 (2003) 5 SCC 257 held by this Court that continuation of such a prosecution would be inconsistent with the intent and provisions of the law. The Appellant therein was also obliged to withdraw the appeal before this Court, which might have had also impacted the merits of the criminal proceedings as against them. 21. The above ratio, as laid down by this Court, would be fully applicable to the case-at-hand, especially when it is not in dispute that the Commissioner of Customs (Appeals), Kandla returned a finding that the Appellant-Company was not required to pay the CVD on the basis of MRP, but as per the invoice value. This is in consonance with the submission of the Appellant-Company. On remand to the Assessing Authority for decision afresh on the liability, it had observed that the Appellant-Company was entitled to a refund of INR 1.39 Crores out of the INR 1,51,45,378/- (Rupees One Crore Fifty One Lakhs Forty Five Thousand and Three Hundred Seventy Eight only) paid by it to the Revenue Authorities as per the demand made earlier for the purpose of clearance of the concerned goods. This position is also admitted by the Respondent-Agency in its Counter Affidavit dated 19.04.2024. Moreover, the said Order was never challenged by the Revenue Authorities, and has, thus, attained finality. 22. Furthermore, the Appellant-Company had successfully claimed immunity from prosecution under the CA 1962, CE Act 1944, and IPC 1860 vide Order dated 21.08.2007. In such a Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/120309590/ 5 Baccarose Perfumes And Beauty Products ... vs Central Bureau Of Investigation on 6 September, 2024 circumstance, there was no fiscal liability on the Appellant-Company, and accordingly, the Order dated 01.08.2010 passed by learned Special Judge, taking cognizance against the Appellant-Company, ought not to have sustained. As the very basis of the allegation of offence against the Appellant-Company was found to be non- existent, it would have amounted to misuse rather abuse of the process of law. It may be added here that the prosecution sanction as sought against the officials of KASEZ, who were said to have committed the offences under PCA 1988, stood declined. In the light of this additional fact, the application for discharge, as moved by the Appellant-Company, ought to have been accepted by the learned Special Judge. 23. In light of the above, the present Appeal is allowed. The proceedings against the Appellant-Company are quashed by setting aside the Impugned Order dated 15.09.2023 passed by the High Court of Gujarat in CRA No. 783 of 2017 and the Order dated 01.06.2010 passed by the Special Judge in RC6(A)/2005. 24. Pending applications, if any, stand disposed of. ....………………………………. J. (ABHAY S. OKA) ……………………………………J. (AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH) NEW DELHI; SEPTEMBER 06, 2024.

Pathak Bench: R.S. Pathak, R.S. Sarkaria JUDGMENT R.S. Pathak, J. 1. In this appeal by certificate, the appellant is aggrieved by the quantum of compensation awarded by e Andhra Pradesh High Court in respect of land acquired under the Land Acquisition Act. 2. The appellant is the owner of Ac-1-01 cent of land situated in R. S-No. 21/1 in Handapadu village in the Gudivada Municipality. At the instance of the General Manager, Southern Railways, Madras, the Government acquired 91 cents of the land in connection with the conversion of the existing meter-gauge to a broad-gauge track on the Gudivada Masulipatam line. The notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act was published on 6th July, 1961. In the proceedings for determining the compensation the appellant entered a claim at the rate of Rs. 50,000/- per acre. The Land Acquisition Officer, however, proceeded on the basis that die land was agricultural land and awarded compensation at Rs. 6,000/- per acre. Thereafter, at the instance of the appellant a reference under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act was made to the District Court. The reference came on before the learned Subordinate Judge, and he determined the market value of the acquired land at Rs- 46,000/- per acre. The State appealed to the High Court, and the High Court has awarded compensation at the rate of Rs. 17,0007- per acre which in respect of the 91 cents of land amounts to Rupees 14,470/-. An additional amount of Rupees 1,0007- as damages for severance of the acquired land from the parent parcel was also awarded. In addition, the appellant was held entitled to solatium at 15 pet cent and interest at 4 per cent per annum from the date of dispossession. The appellant then applied for and obtained a certificate under Article 133(1) of the Constitution. And hence this appeal. 2A. It is contended for the appellant that the High Court erred in declining to consider Ex. A-5, an award of the Special Tahsildar. Gudivada, made on 24th December, 1962 in respect of 38 cents of land lying to the west of the land acquired. Compensation in respect- of that piece of land was awarded at Rs. 58,080/- per acre. Reliance was also placed on the rental of a piece of land of Ac. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/676429/ 1 Adusumilli Gopalakrishna vs Special Deputy Collector (Land ... on 17 April, 1980 1-25 cents in R. S No. 14, which was leased for two timber depots for a rent of Rs. 3,6007-pev aero and it was pointed out, the Land Acquisition Officer, adopting the method of capitalisition determined the market value of R.S. No. 14 at Rs. 48,000/- per acre. It is submitted that the High Court should have taken into consideration the compensation so awarded on the capitalisition method. The potential value of the land, it is said, was also a factor to be taken into consideration. On behalf of the respondents the submission is that the High Court was right in not following the capitalisition method because the sale deeds of similar parcels of land in the neighbourhood were available as exemplars for a comparative valuation. 3. We have considered the matter carefully and it seems to us fair and just, having regard to the material before us, that the compensation should be fixed at Rs. 20,0007- per acre, severance damages at Rs. 1,000/- solatium at 15 per cent and interest at 4 per cent per annum from the date of dispossession. An assessment of the compensation payable for land acquired must take into account several factors, including the nature of the land, its present use and its capacity for a higher potential, its precise location in relation to adjoining land, the use to which neighbouring land has been put and the impact of such use on the land acquired, and so on. It seems to us, that having regard to all those factors the rate 'of compensation, which has suggested itself to us is what should be decreed. 4. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the judgment and decree of the High Court are modified in so far that while the damages for severance at Rs. 1.000/-solatium at 15 per cent and interest at 4 per cent per annum from the date of dispossession are maintained the compensation is awarded at Rs. 20,0007- per acre. There is no order as to costs. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/676429/ 2"

Comptroller & Auditor-General's Manual of Standing Orders para 143-whether could be amended by departmental instructions. HEADNOTE: In 1921 the Auditor-General, as the administrative head of the Indian Audit Department, inserted Article 1666A by a circular No. 1757-E/1129 dated 18th April 1921 giving weight to the length of service as Upper Division Clerks in the fixation of seniority in the Subordinate Accounts Service. In the Audit Code prepared subsequently, Article 1666A appeared as Article 52. Thereafter, in the Manual of Standing Orders issued by the Auditor-General in 1938, Article 52 found expression as paragraph 143. By a correction slip dated 27th July, 1956, the Comptroller and Auditor-General removed the factor of weightage on the basis of length of service in the determination of seniority. The respondents in the appeals, who had entered service in the Office of the Accountant General, as Upper Division Clerks, appeared in the Subordinate Accounts Service Examination and passed the examination held in November 1969, and were promoted shortly thereafter. They claimed seniority on the basis that their length of service in the inferior post should be taken into account, and rested their claim on paragraph 143 of the Manual of Standing Orders as it stood prior to its amendment by the correction slip of 27th July 1956. The claim was rejected by the Comptroller and Auditor-General A writ petition filed by them in the High Court was allowed by a Single Judge and the judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Bench of the High Court. The Accountant-General and the Comptroller and Auditor- General appealed to this Court. During the pendency of the appeals, the President enacted 156 the Indian Audit and Accounts Department (Subordinate Accounts Service & Subordinate Railway Audit Service) Service Rules, 1974. They were deemed to have come into force on 27th July, 1956. These rules purported to give statutory recognition to the amendment of paragraph 143 by the Comptroller and Auditor-General. Rule 6 provided for appointments to the service and Rule 7 dealt with seniority. Rule 9 provided that in matters not specifically provided for the rules, regulations, orders or instructions of the Central Civil Services as applicable to the Indian Audit and Accounts Department would be applicable. Rule 10 empowered the Comptroller and Auditor-General to issue general or special instructions for giving effect to the Rules. In the appeals, the respondents assailed the validity Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171548/ 2 Accountant General & Anr. Etc. Etc vs S. Doraiswamy & Ors. Etc. Etc on 13 November, 1980 of the Rules of 1974 and the amendment made in paragraph 143, contending that the Rules are invalid as clause (5) of Article 148 does not permit the retrospective enactment of rules made thereunder, that the specific rules affecting the seniority of the respondents are invalid because in entrusting power to the Comptroller and Auditor-General to issue orders and instructions in his discretion the doctrine against excessive delegation of legislative power has been violated, and that paragraph 143 possesses the status of a statutory rule and, therefore, the amendment attempted by the correction slip has no legal effect upon it. In the connected writ petitions, the petitioners who had passed the Subordinate Accounts Service Examination were promoted to the Service after 1956 some before the enactment of the Rules of 1974 and some thereafter. It was contended on their behalf that the fixation of seniority having been made by Rule 7(2) to depend on the order in which appointments to the service were made under Rule 6 depends on an arbitrary power conferred on the Comptroller and Auditor-General to pass orders and instructions. On the question whether the respondents are entitled to claim fixation of their seniority in the Subordinate Accounts Service after taking into account their length of service as Upper Division Clerks. Allowing the appeals and dismissing the writ petitions, ^ HELD: 1. There is nothing in the language of clause (5) of Article 148, to indicate that the rules framed therein were intended to serve until Parliamentary legislation was enacted. All that the clause says is that the rules framed would be subject to the provisions of the Constitution and of any law made by Parliament. Clause (5) of Article 148 confers power on the President to frame rules operating prospectively only. The rules of 1974 cannot have retrospective operation. Sub-rule (2) of rule 1, which declares that they will be deemed to have come into force on 27th July, 1956 is therefore ultra vires. [163B-C] B.S. Vadera v. Union of India & Ors. [1968] 3 S.C.R. 575 referred to. 2. The Comptroller and Auditor-General is a high ranking constitutional authority, and can be expected to act according to the needs of the service and without arbitrariness. He is the constitutional head of one of the most important departments of the State, and is expected to know what the depart- 157 ment requires and how best to fulfil those requirements. The power conferred on him under the Rules does not violate the principle against excessive delegation. [165C-D] 3. Paragraph 143 in the Manual of Standing Orders remained throughout a departmental instruction and, therefore, could be amended by the departmental instruction contained in the correction slip issued by the Comptroller Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171548/ 3 Accountant General & Anr. Etc. Etc vs S. Doraiswamy & Ors. Etc. Etc on 13 November, 1980 and Auditor-General in 1956. [164F] 4. There is a clear dichotomy in the power conferred by Article 309, a division of power between the Parliament or President, as the case may be, on the one side and the State Legislature or Governor on the other. The division is marked by the circumstance that under Article 309 services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union are dealt with by a separate authority from the services and posts in connection with the affairs of a State. That dichotomy is not possible in the power employed for appointing persons in the Indian Audit and Accounts Department and for prescribing their conditions of service. [160H-161A] 5. The authority vested in the Comptroller and Auditor- General ranges over functions associated with the affairs of the States. It is a single office, and the Indian Audit and Accounts Department, which it heads, is a single department. They cannot be said to be concerned with the affairs of the Union exclusively. Consequently, the regulation of the recruitment and conditions of service of persons serving in the Indian Audit and Accounts Department cannot be regarded as a matter falling within the domain of the President within the terms of the proviso to Article 309. [162 C] B. Shiva Rao, ""The Framing of India's Constitution: A Study"" [1968] Chap. 12, pp. 414-417 referred to. 6. It cannot be said that persons serving in the Indian Audit and Accounts Department are holding office in connection with the affairs of the Union exclusively. [161 C] 7. The power contained in clause (5) of Article 148 is not related to the power under the proviso to Article 309. The two powers are separate and distinct from each other and are not complementary to one another. The reference to the proviso under Article 309 in the recital of the Notification publishing the Rules of 1974 is meaningless and must be ignored. [162D-E] 8. Having regard to the provision determining the fixation of seniority under the Rules of 1974 and the position obtaining thereafter, none of the petitioners in the writ petitions can claim the benefit of weightage on the basis of length of service.

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171548/ 4 Accountant General & Anr. Etc. Etc vs S. Doraiswamy & Ors. Etc. Etc on 13 November, 1980 T.S. Krishnamurthy Iyer, H. B. Dattar, A. K.Srivastava and T. P. Sunderarajan for the Petitioners in WPs. Nos. 4367 of 1978 & 357 of 1979. T.S. Krishnamurthy Iyer, Vineet Kumar and A.K. Srivastava for the Respondents. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATHAK, J.-These appeals, by special leave, raise the question whether the respondents are entitled to claim fixation of their seniority in the Subordinate Accounts Service after taking into account their length of service as Upper Division Clerks. The respondents entered service in the Office of the Accountant General, Tamil Nadu as Upper Division Clerks. They appeared in the Subordinate Accounts Service Examination but it was only after a number of attempts that they succeeded in passing. They passed the examination held in November, 1969 and were promoted shortly thereafter. They claimed seniority on the basis that their length of service in the inferior post should be taken into account, and rested their claim on paragraph 143 of the Manual of Standing Orders issued by the Comptroller and Auditor-General as it stood before its amendment by a correction slip of 27th July, 1956. The correction slip removed the factor of weightage on the basis of length of service in the determination of seniority. The claim was rejected by the Comptroller and Auditor-General. A writ petition filed by them in the High Court of Madras was allowed by a learned Single Judge, and his judgment was affirmed by an appellate Bench, of the High Court. Against the judgment of the appellate Bench, the Accountant General, Tamil Nadu and the Comptroller and Auditor-General have appealed to this Court, and those appeals are pending as Civil Appeals Nos. 1584 to 1588 of 1973. During the pendency of those appeals the President enacted the Indian Audit and Accounts Department (Subordinate Accounts Service & Subordinate Railway Audit Service) Service Rules, 1974 (referred to hereinafter as ""the Rules of 1974""). The Rules of 1974 purport to give statutory recognition to the amendment of paragraph 143 by the Comptroller and Auditor- General. The validity of the Rules of 1974 and the amendment made in paragraph 143 are assailed by the respondents in the instant appeals. The Rules of 1974 have been enacted by the President. They are deemed to have come into force on 27th July, 1956, which has been defined, for the purposes of the Rules as the ""appointed day"". The Subordinate Accounts Service (the ""Service"") includes members appointed to it before the appointed day as well as persons recruited to it in or before that day. Rule 5 provides that recruitment shall be made by direct recruitment in accordance with, the orders or directions issued by the Comptroller and Auditor-General from time to time and also by promotion. Rule 6 provides: ""6. Appointments:- Appointments to the Service shall be made from the list prepared in accordance with the orders and instructions issued by the Comptroller and Auditor-General from time to time and applicable at the time of appointment to the Service."" Rule 7 deals with seniority, and declares: ""7. Seniority:- Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171548/ 5 Accountant General & Anr. Etc. Etc vs S. Doraiswamy & Ors. Etc. Etc on 13 November, 1980 (1) The seniority inter-se of the persons appointed to the service before the appointed day shall be regulated by the orders or instructions issued by the Comptroller and Auditor-General as were in force at the relevant time before such day. (2) The seniority-inter-se of the persons appointed to the Service on or after the appointed day shall be in the order in which the appointments are made to the service in accordance with rule 6. Provided that a direct recruit shall on appointment to the Service rank senior to all officiating persons in the service (excluding a direct recruit) passing in the same departmental examination or subsequent departmental examinations. Provided further that the seniority of a person who had declined the appointment to the Service but who is subsequently appointed to the Service shall be determined with reference to the date on which he assumed charge of the post in the cadre."" By virtue of Rule 9, in matters not specifically provided for in the Rules, every person appointed to the Service is governed by the rules, regulations, orders or instructions made or issued in respect of the Central Civil Services as applicable to the Indian Audit and Accounts Department. Rule 10 empowers the Comptroller and Auditor- General to issue, from time to time, such general or special instructions or orders as he may consider necessary or expedient for the purpose of giving, effect to the Rules. The respondents have raised two contentions. The first is that the Rules are invalid as clause (5) of Art. 148 to which alone, it is said, they must be ascribed, does not permit the retrospective enactment of rules made thereunder. The other contention is that the specific rules affecting the seniority of the respondents are in valid be cause in entrusting power to the Comptroller and Auditor-General to issue orders and instructions in his discretion the doctrine against excessive delegation of legislative power has been violated Taking the first contention first, it may be noted that the Rules of 1974 purport, according to the recital in the Notification dated 4th November, 1974 publishing them, to have been made by the President ""in exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to Art. 309 and clause (5) of Art. 148 of the Constitution and after consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India"". The respondents say that the only provision of the Constitution under which those Rules could be made is clause (5) of Art. 148, and we should ignore reference to the proviso to Art. 309. If that is done, they urge, there will be no justification for holding that the Rules of 1974 can be given retrospective operation. Unlike the proviso to Art. 309, it is pointed out, clause (5) of Art. 148 does not permit the enactment of retrospectively operating rules. We think that the respondents are right. Article 309 provides for legislation by the appropriate Legislature to regulate the recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of any State, and the proviso to Art. 309 declares that until such legislation is enacted by the appropriate Legislature the President is empowered in the case of services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union, and the Governor of a State in the case of services and Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171548/ 6 Accountant General & Anr. Etc. Etc vs S. Doraiswamy & Ors. Etc. Etc on 13 November, 1980 posts in connection with the affairs of a State, to make rules regulating the recruitment and the conditions of service of persons appointed to such services and posts. There is a clear dichotomy in the power conferred by Art. 309, a division of power between the Parliament or President, as the case may be, on the one side and the State Legislature or Governor on the other. The division is marked by the circumstance that under Art 309, services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union are dealt with by a separate authority from the services and posts in connection with the affairs of a State. That dichotomy it seems, is not possible in the power employed for appointing persons in the Indian Audit and Accounts Department and for prescribing their conditions of service. The Comptroller and Auditor-General of India, who is the head of that department, is a constitutional functionary holding a special position under the Constitution. Under Art. 149, he performs duties and exercises powers in relation to the accounts of the Union and also of the States. Clause (1) of Art. 151 requires him to submit a report relating to the accounts of the Union to the President, who causes them to be laid before each House of Parliament. Likewise, clause (2) of Art. 151 requires him to submit a report relating to the accounts of a State to the Governor of the State, who causes them to be laid before the Legislature of the State. It cannot be said, in the circumstances, that the persons serving in the Indian Audit and Accounts Department are holding office in connection with the affairs of the Union exclusively. It may be pointed out that when the Constitutional Adviser prepared the Draft Constitution for consideration by the Constituent Assembly the document contained separate provisions for the appointment of the Auditor-General of the Federation and Auditors-General for the Provinces. The Auditor-General for the Federation was to be appointed by the President and his functions extended to the accounts of the Federation as well as of the Provinces. But it was open to a Provincial Legislature to provide by law for the appointment of an Auditor-General for the Province and the appointment to that office was to be made by the Governor. The Expert Committee on the financial provisions of the Union Constitution favoured the continuance of a single Auditor-General for the Government of India as well as for the Provincial Governments and hoped that the Provincial Governments would refrain from using their power of appointing separate Auditors-General of their own. When the matter came before the Drafting Committee, it decided that the persons performing the functions of the Auditor-General in a State should be designated Auditor-in-Chief in order to distinguish him from the Auditor-General of India, and that the salaries and allowances of the staff of these officers should be fixed by the Auditor-General of India and the Auditor-in-Chief in consultation with the President and the Governor respectively. Thereafter, the Drafting Committee reconsidered the desirability of permitting a multiplicity of audit authorities, one for the Union and one for each State. On 1st August, 1949 Shri T.T. Krishnamachari moved an amendment deleting the draft articles enabling the State Legislatures to create their own Auditors-in-Chief. He pointed out that since the Constituent Assembly had already adopted articles whereby the auditing and accounting would become ""one institution, so to say, under the authority of the Comptroller and Auditor-General"", it was not necessary to have separate provision for the States. Accordingly, he proposed the addition of a new article now clause (2) of Art. 151] about the Comptroller and Auditor-General, requiring him to submit the reports of the accounts of a State to the Governor for being laid before the State Legislature. These amendments were adopted by the Constituent Assembly. It is evident that the authority vested in the Comptroller and Auditor General ranges over functions associated with the affairs of the Union as well as over functions associated with the affairs of the States. It is a single office, and the Indian Audit and Accounts Department, which it heads, is a single department. They Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171548/ 7 Accountant General & Anr. Etc. Etc vs S. Doraiswamy & Ors. Etc. Etc on 13 November, 1980 cannot be said to be concerned with the affairs of the Union exclusively. Consequently, the regulation of the recruitment and conditions of service of persons serving in the Indian Audit and Accounts Department cannot be regarded as a matter falling with the domain of the President within the terms of the proviso to Art. 309. A special provision was necessary to entrust the President with that power, and that provision is clause (5) of Art, 148. The power contained in clause (5) of Art. 148 is not related to the power under the proviso to Art. 309. The two powers are separate and distinct from each other and are not complementary to one another. In our opinion, the reference to the proviso under Art. 309 in the recital of the Notification publishing the Rules of 1974 is meaningless and must be ignored. The next question is whether clause (5) of Art. 148 permits the enactment of rules having retrospective operation. It is settled law that unless a statute conferring the power to make rules provides for the making of rules with retrospective operation, the rules made pursuant to that power can have prospective operation only. An exception, however, is the proviso to Art. 309. In B. S. Vadera v. Union of India & Ors. this Court held that the rules framed under the proviso to Art. 309 of the Constitution could have retrospective operation. The conclusion followed from the circumstance that the power conferred under the porviso to Art. 309 was intended to fill a hiatus that is to say, until Parliament or a State Legislature enacted a law on the subject matter of Art. 309. The rules framed under the proviso to Art. 309 were transient in character and were to do duty only until legislation was enacted. As interim substitutes for such legislation it was clearly intended that the rules should have the same range of operation as an Act of Parliament or of the State Legislature. The intent was reinforced by the declaration in the proviso to Art. 309 that ""any rules so made shall have effect subject to the provisions of any such Act"". Those features are absent in clause (5) of Art. 148. There is nothing in the language of that clause to indicate that the rules framed therein were intended to serve until Parliamentary legislation was enacted. All that the clause says is that the rules framed would be subject to the provisions of the Constitution and of any law made by Parliament. We are satisfied that clause (5) of Art. 148 confers power on the President to frame rules operating prospectively only. Clearly then. the rules of 1974 cannot have retrospective operation, and therefore sub-rule (2) of rule 1, which declares that they will be deemed to have come into force on 27th July, 1956 must be held ultra vires. If the Rules of 1974 do not cover the case of the respondents then admittedly the only question which remains in regard to them is whether the amendment intended by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 1956 to paragraph 143 of the Manual of Standing Orders results in amending that paragraph. The amendment is in the form of a correction slip which, it is not disputed, possesses the status of an administrative instruction. The contention on behalf of the respondents is that paragraph 143 possesses the status of a statutory rule and, therefore, the amendment attempted by the correction slip has no legal effect on it. The High Court held that paragraph 143 was a statutory rule and it proceeded to hold so on the basis of affidavits filed before it. But the matter has been more carefully researched since, and the relevant material is now set out in the special leave petition, which has given rise to this appeal. It appears that in 1921 the Auditor-General, as the administrative head of the Indian Audit Department, inserted Art. 1666A by a circular No. 1757-E/1129 dated 18th April, 1921 giving weight to the length of service in the fixation of seniority. In the Audit Code prepared subsequently, Art, 1666A appeared as Art. 52. Thereafter, in the Manual Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171548/ 8 Accountant General & Anr. Etc. Etc vs S. Doraiswamy & Ors. Etc. Etc on 13 November, 1980 of Standing Orders issued by the Auditor-General in 1938, Art. 52 found expression as paragraph 143. The provision never acquired statutory force under the Government of India Act, 1919. Learned counsel for the respondents urges that it acquired statutory force under sub-s. (2) of s. 252. Government of India Act, 1935. Sub-ss. (1) and (2) of s. 252 provide: ""252. (1) All persons who immediately before the commencement of Part III of this Act were members of the staff of the High Commissioner for India, or members of the staff of the Auditor of the accounts of the Secretary of State in Council, shall continue to be, or shall become, members of the staff of the High Commissioner for India or, as the case may be, of the Auditor of Indian Home Accounts. (2) All such persons aforesaid shall hold their offices or posts subject to like conditions of service as to remuneration, pensions or otherwise, as therefore, or not less favourable conditions, and shall be entitled to reckon for purposes of pension any service which they would have been, entitled to reckon if this Act had not been passed. * * * * *"" Sub-s. (2) of s. 252 does not help the respondents. Firstly, the guarantee conferred by it covered those persons who held offices or posts on the staff of the Auditor of the accounts of the Secretary of State in Council and on the staff of the Indian Home Accounts immediately before the commencement of Part III of the Act. The respondents are clearly not such persons. Secondly, even if it be assumed that the benefit of sub-s. (2) can be extended to the respondents, sub-s. (2) merely protects the conditions of service enjoyed by them as they existed before. The sub- section does not enlarge or improve on the quality of those conditions of service. If seniority was determined by a departmental instruction, sub-s. (2) did not give that provision the higher status of a statutory rule. It remained what it always was, a departmental instruction. We were also referred to Art. 313 of the Constitution, but that provision also does not result in converting a departmental instruction into a statutory rule. Plainly, paragraph 143 in the Manual of Standing Orders remained throughout a departmental instruction and, therefore, could be amended by the departmental instruction contained in the correction slip issued by the Comptroller and Auditor-General in 1956. On that conclusion being reached, the claim of the respondents must fail. The appeals have to be allowed. In the connected writ petition No. 357 of 1979 there are 15 petitioners. The first ten passed the Subordinate Accounts Service Examination and were promoted to the service after 1956 and before the enactment of the Rules of 1974. They will be governed by the legal position enunciated in the aforesaid appeals. The eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth petitioners passed the examination immediately before the enactment of the Rules of 1974 but were promoted after the Rules were enacted. The remaining petitioners appeared at the examination and were promoted after the enactment of the Rules. In the case of the last two categories the Rules of 1974 will apply. Having regard to the provision determining the fixation of seniority under the Rules of 1974 and the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/171548/ 9 Accountant General & Anr. Etc. Etc vs S. Doraiswamy & Ors. Etc. Etc on 13 November, 1980 position obtaining thereafter, none of the petitioners can claim the benefit of weigtage on the basis of length of service. But these petitioners rely on the second of the two contentions concerning the validity of the Rules of 1974. They assail specifically the validity of Rule 7(2) which provides for fixation of seniority. The argument is that the fixation of seniority has been made by Rule 7(2) to depend on the order in which appointments to the service are made under Rule 6, and that, it is pointed out, depends on an arbitrary power conferred on the Comptroller and Auditor General to pass orders and instructions. We see no force in the contention. The Comptroller and Auditor General is a high ranking constitutional authority, and can be expected to act according to the needs of the service and without arbitrariness. He is the constitutional head of one of the most important departments of the State, and is expected to know what the department requires and how best to fulfil those requirements. We are unable to hold that the power conferred on him under the Rules violates the principle against excessive delegation. The writ petition No. 4367 of 1978 must also be treated on the basis that the petitioners are not, in the fixation of their seniority, entitled to weightage with reference to their length of service. Both writ petitions must, therefore, be dismissed. Civil Appeals Nos. 1584-1588 of 1973 are allowed, the judgment and order of the Madras High Court is set aside and the writ petition is dismissed. Writ Petition Nos. 357 of 1979 and 4367 of 1978 are also dismissed. In the circumstances, there is no order as to costs. N.V.K. Appeals allowed and Petitions dismissed.

Having regard to the Memorandum of Association and the Rules of the Society, the respondent college is a State within the meaning of Article 12. The composition of the Society is dominated by the representatives appointed by the Central Government and the Governments of Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh with the approval of the Central Government. The monies required for running the college are provided entirely by the Central Government and the Government of Jammu & Kashmir and even if any other monies are to be received by the Society, it can be done only with the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 2 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 approval of the State and the Central Governments. The Rules to be made by the Society are also required to have the prior approval of the State and the Central Governments and the accounts of the Society have also to be submitted to both the Governments for their scrutiny and satisfaction. The Society is also to comply with all such directions as may be issued by the State Government with the approval of the Central Government in respect of any matters dealt with in the report of the Reviewing Committee. The control of the State and the Central Governments is indeed so deep and pervasive that no immovable property of the Society can be disposed of in any manner without the approval of both the Governments. The State and the Central Governments have even the power to appoint any other person or persons to be members of the Society and any member of the Society other than a member representing the State or the Central Government can be removed from the membership of the Society by the State Government with the approval of the Central Government. The Board of Governors, which is incharge of general superintendence, direction and control of the affairs of the Society and of its income and property is also largely controlled by nominees of the State and the Central Governments. The State Government and by reason of the provision for approval, the Central Government also thus have full control of the work- 80 ing of the Society and therefore, the Society is merely a projection of the State and the Central Governments. The voice is that of the State and the Central Governments. The Society is an instrumentality or the agency of the State and the Central Governments and it is an ""authority"" within the meaning of Article 12. If the Society is, an ""authority"" and, therefore, the ""State"" within the meaning of Article 12, it must follow that it is subject to the constitutional obligation under Article 14. [99F-H, 100 K-F] (2) The expression ""other authorities"", in Article 12 must be given an interpretation where constitutional fundamentals vital to the maintenance of human rights are at stake, functional realism and not facial cosmetics must be the diagnostic tool, for constitutional law must seek the substance and not the form. The Government may act through the instrumentality or agency of juridical persons to carry out its functions, since, with the advent of the welfare State its new task have increased manifold. [90B-D] It is, undoubtedly, true that the corporation is a distinct juristic entity with a corporate structure of its own and it carries on its functions on business principles with a certain amount of autonomy which is necessary as well as useful from the point of view of effective business management, but behind the formal ownership which is cast in the corporate mould, the reality is very much the deeply pervasive presence of the Government. It is really the Government which acts through the instrumentality or agency Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 3 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 of the corporation and the juristic veil of corporate personality worn for the purpose of convenience of management and administration cannot be allowed to obliterate the true nature of the reality behind which is the Government. It is clear that if a corporation is an instrumentality or agency of the Government, it must be subject to the same limitations in the field of constitutional law as the Government itself, though in the eye of the law it would be a distinct and independent legal entity. If the Government acting through its officers is subject to certain constitutional limitations, it must follow a fortiorari that the Government acting through the instrumentality or agency of a corporation should equally be subject to the same limitations. If such a corporation were to be free from the basic obligation to obey the Fundamental Rights, it would lead to considerable erosion of the efficiency of the Fundamental Rights, for in that event the Government would be enabled to override the Fundamental Rights by adopting the stratagem of carrying out its functions through the instrumentality or agency of a corporation, while retaining control over it. The Fundamental Rights would then be reduced to little more than an idle dream or a promise of unreality. [91B-F] The Courts should be anxious to enlarge the scope and width of the Fundamental Rights by bringing within their sweep every authority which is an instrumentality or agency of the Government or through the corporate personality of which the Government is acting, so as to subject the Government in all its myriad activities, whether through natural persons or through corporate entities, to the basic obligation of the Fundamental Rights. The constitutional philosophy of a democratic socialist republic requires the Government to under take a multitude of socioeconomic operations and the Government, having regard to the practical advantages of functioning through the legal device of a corporation, embarks on myriad commercial and economic activities by resorting to the instrumentality or agency of a corporation, but this contrivance of carrying on such activities through a corporation cannot exonerate the Government from implicit obedience to the Fundamental Rights. To use the 81 corporate methodology is not to liberate the Government from its basic obligation to respect the Fundamental Rights and not to override them. The mantle of a corporation may be adopted in order to free the Government from the inevitable constraints of red-tapism and slow motion but by doing so, the Government cannot be allowed to play truant with the basic human rights, otherwise it would be the easiest thing for the government to assign to a plurality of corporations almost every State business such as Post and Telegraph, TV, Radio, Rail, Road and Telephones-in short every economic activity-and thereby cheat the people of India out of the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 4 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 Fundamental Rights guaranteed to them. That would be a mockery of the Constitution and nothing short of treachery and breach of faith with the people of India, because though apparently the corporation will be carrying out these functions, it will in truth and reality be the Government which will be controlling the corporation and carrying out these functions through the instrumentality or agency of the corporation. Courts cannot by a process of judicial construction allow the Fundamental Rights to be rendered futile and meaningless and there by wipe out Chapter III from the Constitution. That would be contrary to the constitutional faith of the post-Menaka Gandhi era. It is the Fundamental Rights which along with the Directive Principles constitute the life force of the Constitution and they must be quickened into effective action by meaningful and purposive interpretation. If a corporation is found to be a mere agency or surrogate of the Government, ""in fact owned by the Government, in truth controlled by the government and in effect an incarnation of the government,"" the court must not allow the enforcement of Fundamental Rights to be frustrated by taking the view that it is not the government and, therefore, not subject to the constitutional limitations. Therefore, where a corporation is an instrumentality or agency of the Government, it is an authority within the meaning of Article 12 and, hence, subject to the same basic obligation to obey the Fundamental Rights as the government. [91G-H, 92A-G] R. D. Shetty v. The International Airport Authority of India & Ors., [1979] 1 S.C.R. 1042 and U.P. Warehousing Corporation v. Vijay Narain, [1980] 3 S.C.C. 459, followed. (3) The test for determining as to when a corporation can be said to be an instrumentality or agency of Government may be culled out from the judgment in the International Airport Authority's case. They are not conclusive or clinching, but they are merely indicative indicia which have to be used with care and caution, because while stressing the necessity of a wide meaning to be placed on the expression ""other authorities"", it must be realised that it should not be stretched so far as to bring in every autonomous body which has some nexus with the Government with the sweep of the expression. A wide enlargement of the meaning must be tempered by a wise limitation. The relevant tests gathered from the decision in the International Airport Authority's case may be summarized as: (i) ""One thing is clear that if the entire share capital of the corporation is held by Government it would go a long way towards indicating that the Corporation is an instrumentality or agency of Government. (ii) 'Where the financial assistance of the State is so much as to meet almost entire expenditure of the corporation, it would afford some indication of the corporation being impregnated with governmental character.' (iii) 'It may also be a relevant factor...... whether the corporation enjoys Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 5 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors.

(vi) 'Specifically, if a department of Government is transferred to a corporation, it would be a strong factor supportive of this inference"" of the corporation being an instrumentality or agency of Government.""[96F-H, 97A-D] It is immaterial for this purpose whether the corporation is created by a statute or under a statute. The test is whether it is an instrumentality or agency of the Government and not as to how it is created. The enquiry has to be not as to how the juristic person is born but why it has been brought into existence. The corporation may be a statutory corporation created by a statute or it may be a Government company or a company formed under the Companies Act, 1956 or it may be a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 or any other similar statute. Whatever be its genetical origin, it would be an ""authority"" within the meaning of Article 12 if it is an instrumentality or agency of the Government and that would have to be decided on a proper assessment of the facts in the light of the relevant factors. The concept of instrumentality or agency of the Government is not limited to a corporation created by a statute but is equally applicable to a company or society and in a given case it would have to be decided, on a consideration of the relevant factors, whether the company or society is an instrumentality or agency of the Government so as to come within the meaning of the expression ""authority"" in Article 12. [97F-H, 98A-B] (4) Merely because a juristic entity may be an ""authority"" and, therefore, ""State"" within the meaning of Article 12, it may not be elevated to the position of ""State"" for the purpose of Articles 309, 310 and 311 which find a place in Part XIV. The definition of ""State"" in Article 12 which includes an ""authority"" within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India is limited in its application only to Part III and by virtue of Article 36, to Part IV and it does not extend to the other provisions of the Constitution and, hence, a juristic entity which may be ""State"" for the purpose of Parts III and IV would not be so for the purpose of Part XIV or any other provision of the Constitution.

(5) Article 14 must not be identified with the doctrine of classification. What Article 14 strikes at is arbitrariness because any action that is arbitrary, must necessarily involve negation of equality. The doctrine of classification which is evolved by the courts is not para- phrase of Article 14 nor is it the objective and end of that Article. It is merely a judicial formula for determining whether the legislative or executive action in question is arbitrary and therefore constituting denial of equality. If the classification is not reasonable and does not satisfy the two conditions, namely, (1) that the classification is founded on an intelligible differentia and (2) that differentia has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the impugned legislative or executive action, the impugned legislative or executive action, would plainly be arbitrary and the guarantee of equality under Article 14 would be breached. Wherever, therefore, there is arbitrariness in State action whether it be the 83 legislature or of the executive or of an ""authority"" under Article 12, Article 14 immediately springs into action and strikes down such State action. In fact, the concept of reasonableness and non-arbitrariness pervades the entire constitutional scheme and is a golden thread which runs through the whole of the fabric of the Constitution.

The International Airport, Authority of India, & Ors., [1979] 1 S.C.R. 1042, applied. (6) The procedure adopted by the respondent Society cannot be regard as arbitrary merely because it refused to take into account the marks obtained by the candidates at the qualifying examination but chose to regulate the admissions by relying on the entrance test. The entrance test facilitates the assessment of the comparative talent of the candidates by application of a uniform standard and is always preferable to evaluation of comparative merit on the basis of marks obtained at the qualifying examination, when the qualifying examination is held by two or more different authorities, because lack of uniformity is bound to creep into the assessment of candidates by different authorities with different modes of examination. [103A-B, D-F] (7) The oral interview test is undoubtedly not a very satisfactory test for assessing and evaluating the capacity and calibre of candidates, but in the absence of any better test for measuring personal characteristics and traits, the oral interview test must, at the present stage, be regarded as not irrational or irrelevant though it is subjective and based on first impression, its result is influenced by many uncertain factors and it is capable of abuse.

Etc on 13 November, 1980 employment, the oral interview test as presently held should not be relied upon as an exclusive test, but it may be resorted to only as an additional or supplementary test and, moreover, great care must be taken to see that persons who are appointed to conduct the oral interview test are men of high integrity, calibre and qualification. [106C-E] R.Chitra Lakha and Others v. State of Mysore and Others, [1964] 6 S.C.R. 368, followed. (8) Having regard to the drawbacks and deficiencies in the oral interview test and the conditions prevailing in the country, particularly when there is deterioration in moral values and corruption and nepotism are very much on the increase, allocation of a high percentage of marks for the oral interview as compared to the marks allocated for the written test, is not free from the vice of arbitrariness. The allocation of as high a percentage as 33 1/3 of the total marks for oral interview suffers from the vice of arbitrariness. [107A-D] The court, however, to avoid immense hardship being caused to those students in whose case the validity of the selection cannot otherwise be questioned and who have nearly completed three semesters and taking into consideration the fact that even if the petitioners are ultimately found to be deserving of selection on the application of the proper test, it would not be possible to restore them to the position as if they were admitted for the academic year 1979-80, which has run out long since declined to set aside the selection made. The Court was, however, of the view that under the existing circumstances. 84 allocation of more than 15% of the total marks for the oral interview would be arbitrary and unreasonable. [107G-H, 108A-F] A. Peeriakaruppan v. State of Tamil Nadu, [1971] 2 S.C.R. 430; Miss Nishi Meghu v. State of Jammu & Kashmir & Ors., [1980] 3 S.C.R. p. 1253, applied. (9) There can be no doubt that if the interview did not last for more than two or three minutes on an average and the questions asked had no bearing on the factors required to be taken into account the oral interview test would be vitiated, because it would be impossible in such an interview to assess the merit of a candidate with reference to these factors. Here the absence of proper affidavit by the members of the committee to the contrary leads to the only conclusion that the selection made on the basis of such test must be held to be arbitrary. However, if the marks allocated for the oral interview do not exceed 15% of the total marks and the candidates are properly interviewed and relevant questions are asked with a view to assessing their suitability with reference to the factors required to be taken into consideration, the oral interview test would satisfy the criterion of reasonableness and non- arbitrariness. Further it would be desirable if the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 8 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors.

These writ petitions under Article 32 of the Constitution challenge the validity of the admissions made to the Regional Engineering College, Srinagar for the academic year 1979-80. The Regional Engineering College, Srinagar (hereinafter referred to as the College) is one of the fifteen Engineering Colleges in the country sponsored by the Government of India. The College is established and its administration and management are carried on by a Society registered under the Jammu and Kashmir Registration of Societies Act, 1898. The Memorandum of Association of the Society in clause 3 sets out the objects for which the Society is incorporated and they include amongst other things establishment of the college with a view to providing instruction and research in such branches of engineering and technology as the college may think fit and for the advancement of learning and knowledge in such branches. Vide subclause (i). The Society is empowered by clause 3 sub- clause (ii) of the Memorandum of Association to make rules for the conduct of the affairs of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 9 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 the Society and to add to, amend, vary or rescind them from time to time with the approval of the Government of Jammu and Kashmir State (hereinafter referred to as the State Government) and the Central Government. Clause 3 sub-clause (iii) of the Memorandum of Association confers power on the Society to acquire and hold property in the name of the State Government. Sub-clause (v) of clause 3 of the Memorandum of Association contemplates that monies for running the college would be provided by the State and Central Governments and sub-clause (vi) requires the Society to deposit all monies credited to its fund in such banks or to invest them in such manner as the Society may, with the approval of the State Government decide. The accounts of the Society as certified by a duly appointed auditor are mandatorily required by sub- clause (ix) of clause 3 of the Memorandum of Association to be forwarded annually to the State and Central Governments. Clause 6 of the Memorandum of Association empowers the State Government to appoint one or more persons to review the working and progress of the Society, or the college and to hold inquiries into the affairs thereof and to make a report and on receipt of any such report, the State Government has power, with the approval of the Central Government, to take such action and issue such directions as it may consider necessary in respect of any of the matters dealt with in the report and the Society or the College, as the case may be, is bound to comply with such directions. There is a provision made in clause 7 of the Memorandum of Association that in case the Society or the college is not functioning properly, the State Government will have the power to take over the administration and assets of the college with the prior approval of the Central Government. The founding members of the Society are enumerated in clause 9 of the Memorandum of Association and they are the Chairman to be appointed by the State Government with the approval of the Central Government, two representatives of the State Government, one representative of the Central Government, two representatives of the All India Council for Technical Education to be nominated by the northern Regional Committee, one representative of the University of Jammu and Kashmir, one non-official representative of each of the Punjab, Rajasthan, U.P. and Jammu and Kashmir States to be appointed by the respective Governments in consultation with the Central Government and the Principal who shall also be the ex-officio Secretary. The Rules of the Society are also important as they throw light on the nature of the Society. Rule 3 clause (i) reiterates the composition of the Society as set out in clause 9 of the Memorandum of Association and clause (ii) of that Rule provides that the State and the Central Governments may by mutual consultation at any time appoint any other person or persons to be member or members of the Society. Rule 6 vests the general superintendence, direction and control of the affairs and its income and property in the governing body of the Society which is called the Board of Governors. Rule 7 lays down the constitution of the Board of Governors by providing that it shall consist of the Chief Minister of the State Government as Chairman and the following as members : Three nominees of the State Government, three nominees of the Central Government, one representative of the All India Council for Technical Education, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Jammu and Kashmir, two industrialists/technologists in the region to be nominated by the State Government, one nominee of the Indian Institute of Technology in the region, one nominee of the University Grants Commission two representatives of the Faculty of the College and the Principal of the college as ex-officio member-Secretary. The State Government is empowered by rule 10 to remove any member of the Society other than a member representing the State or Central Government from the membership of the Society with the approval of the Central Government. Clause (iv) of Rule 15 Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 10 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 confers power on the Board to make bye-laws for admission of students to various courses and clause (xiv) of that Rule empowers the Board to delegate to a committee or to the Chairman such of its powers for the conduct of its business as it may deem fit, subject to the condition that the action taken by the committee of the Chairman shall be reported for confirmation at the next meeting of the Board. Clause (xv) of Rule 15 provides that the Board shall have power to consider and pass resolution on the annual report, the annual accounts and other financial estimates of the college, but the annual report and the annual accounts together with the resolution passed thereon are required to be submitted to the State and the Central Governments. The Society is empowered by Rule 24, clause (i) to alter, extend or abridge any purpose or purposes for which it is established, subject to the prior approval of the State and the Central Governments and clause (ii) of Rule 24 provides that the Rules may be altered by a Resolution passed by a majority of 2/3rd of the members present at the meeting of the Society, but such alteration shall be with the approval of the State and the Central Governments. Pursuant to clause (iv) of Rule 15 of the Rules, the Board of Governors laid down the procedure for admission of students to various courses in the college by a Resolution dated 4th June, 1974. We are not directly concerned with the admission procedure laid down by this Resolution save and except that under this Resolution admissions to the candidates belonging to the State of Jammu and Kashmir were to be given on the basis of comparative merit to be determined by holding a written entrance test and a viva voce examination and the marks allocated for the written test in the subjects of English, Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics were 100, while for viva voce examination, the marks allocated were 50 divided as follows: (i) General Knowledge and Awareness-15; (ii) Broad understanding of Specific Phenomenon-15; (iii) Extra-curricular activities-10 and (iv) General Personality Trait-10, making up in the aggregate-50. The admissions to the college were governed by the procedure laid down in this Resolution until the academic year 197980, when the procedure was slightly changed and it was decided that out of 250 seats, which were available for admission, 50% of the seats shall be reserved for candidates belonging to the Jammu & Kashmir State and the remaining 50% for candidates belonging to other States including 15 seats reserved for certain categories of students. So far as the seats reserved for candidates belonging to States other than Jammu & Kashmir were concerned, certain reservations were made for candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and sons and wards of defence personnel killed or disabled during hostilities and it was provided that ""inter se merit will be determined on the basis of marks secured in the subjects of English, Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics only"". The provision made with regard to seats reserved for candidates belonging to Jammu & Kashmir State was that ""apart from 2 seats reserved for the sons and daughters of the permanent college employees, reservations shall be made in accordance with the Orders of Jammu and Kashmir Government for admission to technical institutions and the seats shall be filled up on the basis of comparative merit as determined under the following scheme, both for seats to be filled on open merit and for reserved seats in each category separately; (1) marks for written test-100 and (2) marks for viva voce examination-50, marking up in the aggregate-150. It was not mentioned expressly that the marks for the written test shall be in the subjects of Physics, English, Chemistry and Mathematics nor were the factors to be taken into account in the viva voce examination and the allocation of marks for such factors indicated specifically in the admission procedure laid down for the academic year 1979-80, but we were told and this was not disputed on behalf of the petitioners in any of the writ Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 11 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 petitions, that the subjects in which the written test was held were English, Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics and the marks at the viva voce examination were allocated under the same four heads and in the same manner as in the case of admissions under the procedure laid down in the Resolution dated 4th June, 1974. In or about April 1979, the college issued a notice inviting applications for admission to the first semester of the B.E. course in various branches of engineering and the notice set out the above admission procedure to be followed in granting admissions for the academic year 1979-80. The petitioners in the writ petitions before us applied for admission to the first semester of the B.E. course in one or the other branch of engineering and they appeared in the written test which was held on 16th and 17th June, 1979. The petitioners were thereafter required to appear before a Committee consisting of three persons for viva voce test and they were interviewed by the Committee. The case of the petitioners was that the interview of each of them did not last for more than 2 or 3 minutes per candidate on an average and the only questions which were asked to them were formal questions relating to their parentage and residence and hardly any question was asked which would be relevant to any of the four factors for which marks were allocated at the viva voce examination. When the admissions were announced, the petitioners found that though they had obtained very good marks in the qualifying examination, they had not been able to secure admission to the college because the marks awarded to them at the viva voce examination were very low and candidates who had much less marks at the qualifying examination, had succeeded in obtaining very high marks at the viva voce examination and there by managed to secure admission in preference to the petitioners. The petitioners filed before us a chart showing by way of comparison the marks obtained by the petitioners on the one hand and some of the successful candidates on the other at the qualifying examination, in the written test and at the viva voce exami- nation. This chart shows beyond doubt that the successful candidates whose marks are given in the chart had obtained fairly low marks at the qualifying examination as also in the written test, but they had been able to score over the petitioners only on account of very high marks obtained by them at the viva voce examination. The petitioners feeling aggrieved by this mode of selection filed the present writ petitions challenging the validity of the admissions made to the college on various grounds. Some of these grounds stand concluded by the recent decision of this Court in Miss Nishi Maghu v. State of Jammu & Kasmir & Ors. and they were therefore not pressed before us. Of the other grounds, only one was canvassed before us and we shall examine it in some detail. But before we proceed to consider the merits of this ground of challenge, we must dispose of a preliminary objection raised on behalf of the respondents against the maintainability of the writ petition. The respondents contended that the college is run by society which is not a corporation created by a statute but is a society registered under the Jammu & Kashmir Societies Registration Act, 1898 and it is therefore not an 'authority' within the meaning of Art. 12 of the Constitution and no writ petition can be maintained against it, nor can any complaint be made that it has acted arbitrarily in the matter of granting admissions and violated the equality clause of the Constitution. Now it is obvious that the only ground on which the validity of the admissions to the college can be assailed is that the society adopted an arbitrary procedure for selecting candidates for admission to the college and this resulted in denial of equality to the petitioners in the matter of admission Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 12 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution. It would appear that prima facie protection against infraction of Art. 14 is available only against the State and complaint of arbitrariness and denial of equality can therefore be sustained against the society only if the society can be shown to be State for the purpose of Art. 14. Now 'State' is defined in Art. 12 to include inter alia the Government of India and the Government of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India and the question therefore is whether the Society can be said to be 'State' within the meaning of this definition. Obviously the Society cannot be equated with the Government of India or the Government of any State nor can it be said to be a local authority and therefore, it must come within the expression ""other authorities"" if it is to fall within the definition of 'State'. That immediately leads us to a consideration of the question as to what are the ""other authorities"" contemplated in the definition of 'State' in Art. 13. While considering this question it is necessary to bear in mind that an authority falling within the expression ""other authorities"" is, by reason of its inclusion within the definition of 'State' in Article 12, subject to the same constitutional limitations as the Government and is equally bound by the basic obligation to obey the constitutional mandate of the Fundamental Rights enshrined in Part III of the Constitution. We must therefore give such an interpretation to the expression ""other authorities"" as will not stultify the operation and reach of the fundamental rights by enabling the Government to its obligation in relation to the Fundamental Rights by setting up an authority to act as its instrumentality or agency for carrying out its functions. Where constitutional fundamentals vital to the maintenance of human rights are at stake, functional realism and not facial cosmetics must be the diagnostic tool, for constitutional law must seek the substance and not the form. Now it is obvious that the Government may act through the instrumentality or agency of natural persons or it may employ the instrumentality or agency of juridical persons to carry out its functions. In the early days when the Government had limited functions, it could operate effectively through natural persons constituting its civil service and they were found adequate to discharge governmental functions which were of traditional vintage. But as the tasks of the Government multiplied with the advent of the welfare State, it began to be increasingly felt that the frame work of civil service was not sufficient to handle the new tasks which were often specialised and highly technical in character and which called for flexibility of approach and quick decision making. The inadequacy of the civil service to deal with these new problems came to be realised and it became necessary to forge a new instrumentality or administrative device for handing these new problems. It was in these circumstances and with a view to supplying this administrative need that the corporation came into being as the third arm of the Government and over the years it has been increasingly utilised by the Government for setting, up and running public enterprises and carrying out other public functions. Today with increasing assumption by the Government of commercial ventures and economic projects, the corporation has become an effective legal contrivance in the hands of the Government for carrying out its activities, for it Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 13 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 is found that this legal facility of corporate instrument provides considerable flexibility and elasticity and facilitates proper and efficient management with professional skills and on business principles and it is blissfully free from ""departmental rigidity, slow motion procedure and hierarchy of officers"". The Government in many of its commercial ventures and public enterprises is resorting to more and more frequently to this resourceful legal contrivance of a corporation because it has many practical advantages and at the same time does not involve the slightest diminution in its ownership and control of the undertaking. In such cases ""the true owner is the State, the real operator is the State and the effective controllorate is the State and accountability for its actions to the community and to Parliament is of the State."" It is undoubtedly true that the corporation is a distinct juristic entity with a corporate structure of its own and it carries on its functions on business principles with a certain amount of autonomy which is necessary as well as useful from the point of view of effective business management, but behind the formal ownership which is cast in the corporate mould, the reality is very much the deeply pervasive presence of the Government. It is really the Government which acts through the instrumentality or agency of the corporation and the juristic veil of corporate personality worn for the purpose of convenience of management and administration cannot be allowed to obliterate the true nature of the reality behind which is the Government. Now it is obvious that if a corporation is an instrumentality or agency of the Government, it must be subject to the same limitations in the field of constitutional law as the Government itself, though in the eye of the law it would be a distinct and independent legal entity. If the Government acting through its officers is subject to certain constitutional limitations, it must follow a fortiorari that the Government acting through the instrumentality or agency of a corporation should equally be subject to the same limitations. If such a corporation were to be free from the basic obligation to obey the Fundamental Rights, it would lead to considerable erosion of the efficiency of the Fundamental Rights, for in that event the Government would be enabled to over-ride the Fundamental Rights by adopting the stratagem of carrying out its functions through the instrumentality or agency of a corporation, while retaining control over it. The Fundamental Rights would then be reduced to little more than an idle dream or a promise of unreality. It must be remembered that the Fundamental Rights are constitutional guarantees given to the people of India and are not merely paper hopes or fleeting promises and so long as they find a place in the Constitution, they should not be allowed to be emasculated in their application by a narrow and constricted judicial interpretation. The courts should be anxious to enlarge the scope and width of the Fundamental Rights by bringing within their sweep every authority which is an instrumentality or agency of the Government or through the corporate personality of which the Government is acting, so as to subject the Government in all its myriad activities, whether through natural persons or through corporate entities, to the basic obligation of the Fundamental Rights. The constitutional philosophy of a democratic socialist republic requires the Government to undertake a multitude of socioeconomic operations and the Government, having regard to the practical advantages of functioning through the legal device of a Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 14 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 corporation, embarks on myriad commercial and economic activities by resorting to the instrumentality or agency of a corporation, but this contrivance of carrying on such activities through a corporation cannot exonerate the Government from implicit obedience to the Fundamental Rights. To use the corporate methodology is not to liberate the Government from its basic obligation to respect the Fundamental Rights and not to over-ride them. The mantle of a corporation may be adopted in order to free the Government from the inevitable constraints of red-tapism and slow motion but by doing so, the Government cannot be allowed to play truant with the basic human rights. Otherwise it would be the easiest thing for the government to assign to a plurality of corporations almost every State business such as Post and Telegraph, TV and Radio, Rail Road and Telephones-in short every economic activity-and there by cheat the people of India out of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed to them. That would be a mockery of the Constitution and nothing short of treachery and breach of faith with the people of India, because, though apparently the corporation will be carrying out these functions, it will in truth and reality be the Government which will be controlling the corporation and carrying out these functions through the instrumentality or agency of the corporation. We cannot by a process of judicial construction allow the Fundamental Rights to be rendered futile and meaningless and thereby wipe out Chapter III from the Constitution. That would be contrary to the constitutional faith of the post- Menaka Gandhi era. It is the Fundamental Rights which along with the Directive Principles constitute the life force of the Constitution and they must be quickened into effective action by meaningful and purposive interpretation. If a corporation is found to be a mere agency or surrogate of the Government, ""in fact owned by the Government, in truth controlled by the government and in effect an incarnation of the government,"" the court must not allow the enforcement of Fundamental Rights to be frustrated by taking the view that it is not the government and therefore not subject to the constitutional limitations. We are clearly of the view that where a corporation is an instrumentality or agency of the government, it must be held to be an 'authority' within the meaning of Art. 12 and hence subject to the same basic obligation to obey the Fundamental Rights as the government. We may point out that this very question as to when a corporation can be regarded as an 'authority' within the meaning of Art. 12 arose for consideration before this Court in R. D. Shetty v. The International Airport Authority of India & Ores. There, in a unanimous judgment of three Judges delivered by one of us (Bhagwati, J) this Court pointed out: ""So far as India is concerned, the genesis of the emergence of corporations as instrumentalities or agencies of Government is to be found in the Government of India Resolution on Industrial Policy dated 6th April, 1948 where it was stated inter alia that ""management of State enterprises will as a rule be through the medium of public corporation under the statutory control of the Central Government who will assume such powers as may be necessary to ensure this."" Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 15 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 It was in pursuance of the policy envisaged in this and sub-sequent resolutions on Industrial policy that corporations were created by Government for setting up and management of public enterprises and carrying out other public functions. Ordinarily these functions could have been carried out by Government departmentally through its service personnel but the instrumentality or agency of the corporation was resorted to in these cases having regard to the nature of the task to be performed. The corporations acting as instrumentality or agency of Government would obviously be subject to the same limitations in the field of constitutional and administrative law as Government itself, though in the eye of the law, they would be distinct and independent legal entities. If Government acting through its officers is subject to certain constitutional and public law limitations, it must follow a fortiori that Government acting through instrumentality or agency of corporations should equally be subject to the same limitations."" The Court then addressed itself to the question as to how to determine whether a corporation is acting as an instrumentality or agency of the Government and dealing with that question, observed: ""A corporation may be created in one of two ways. It may be either established by statute or incorporated under a law such as the Companies Act 1956 or the Societies Registration Act 1860. Where a Corporation is wholly controlled by Government not only in its policy making but also in carrying out the functions entrusted to it by the law establishing it or by the Charter of its incorporation, there can be no doubt that it would be an instrumentality or agency of Government. But ordinarily where a corporation is established by statute, it is autonomous in its working, subject only to a provision, often times made, that it shall be bound by any directions that may be issued from time to time by Government in respect of policy matters. So also a corporation incorporated under law is managed by a board of directors or committee of management in accordance with the provisions of the statute under which it is in corporated. When does such a corporation become an instrumentality or agency of Government? Is the holding of the entire share capital of the Corporation by Government enough or is it necessary that in addition there should be a certain amount of direct control exercised by Government and, if so what should be the nature of such control? Should the functions which the Corporation is charged to carry out possess any particular characteristic or feature, or is the nature of the functions immaterial? Now, one thing is clear that if the entire share capital of the corporation is held by Government, it would go a long way towards indicating that the corporation is an instrumentality or agency of Government. But, as is quite often the case, a corporation established by statute may have no shares or shareholders, in which case it would be a relevant factor to consider whether the administration is in the hands of a board of directors appointed by Government though this consideration also may not be determinative, because even where the directors are appointed by Government, they may be completely free from governmental control in the discharge of their functions. What then are tests to determine whether a corporation established by statute or incorporated under law is an instrumentality or agency of Government ? It is not possible to formulate an inclusive or exhaustive test which would adequately answer this question. There is no cut and dried formula, which would provide the correct division of corporations into those which are Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 16 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 instrumentalities or agencies of Government and those which are not."" The Court then proceeded to indicate the different tests, apart from ownership of the entire share capital: "" .... if extensive and unusual financial assistance is given and the purpose of the Government in giving such assistance coincides with the purpose for which the corporation is expected to use the assistance and such purpose is of public character, it may be a relevant circumstance supporting an inference that the corporation is an instrumentality or agency of Government..... It may therefore be possible to say that where the financial assistance of the State is so much as to meet almost entire expenditure of the corporation, it would afford some indication of the corporation being impregnated with governmental character ..........But a finding of State financial support plus an unusual degree of control over the management and policies might lead one to characterise an operation as State action-Vide Sukhdev v. Bhagatram [1975] 3 SCR 619 at 658. So also the existence of deep and pervasive State control may afford an indication that the Corporation is a State agency or instrumentality. It may also be a relevant factor to consider whether the corporation enjoys monopoly status which is State conferred or State protected. There can be little doubt that State conferred or State protected monopoly status would be highly relevant in assessing the aggregate weight of the corporation's ties to the State."" ""There is also another factor which may be regarded as having a bearing on this issue and it is whether the operation of the corporation is an important public function. It has been held in the United States in a number of cases that the concept of private action must yield to a conception of State action where public functions are being performed. Vide Arthur S. Miller: ""The Constitutional Law of the Security State"" (10) Stanford Law Review 620 at 664)."" ""It may be noted that besides the so-called traditional functions, the modern state operates as multitude of public enterprises and discharges a host of other public functions. If the functions of the corporation are of public importance and closely related to governmental functions, it would be a relevant factor in classifying the corporation as an instrumentality or agency of Government. This is precisely what was pointed out by Mathew, J., in Sukhdev v. Bhagatram (supra) where the learned Judge said that ""institutions engaged in matters of high public interest of performing public functions are by virtue of the nature of the functions performed government agencies. Activities which are too fundamental to the society are by definition too important not to be considered government functions."" The court however proceeded to point out with reference to the last functional test: ""......... the decisions show that even this test of public or governmental character of the function is not easy of application and does not invariably lead to the correct Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 17 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 inference because the range of governmental activity is broad and varied and merely because an activity may be such as may legitimately be carried on by Government, it does not mean that a corporation, which is otherwise a private entity, would be an instrumentality or agency of Government by reason of carrying on such activity. In fact, it is difficult to distinguish between governmental functions and non- governmental functions. Perhaps the distinction between governmental and non-governmental functions is not valid any more in a social welfare State where the laissez faire is an outmoded concept and Herbert Spencer's social statics has no place. The contrast is rather between governmental activities which are private and private activities which are governmental. [Mathew, J. Sukhdev v. Bhagatram (supra) at p. 652]. But the public nature of the function, if impregnated with governmental character or ""tied or entwined with Government"" or fortified by some other additional factor, may render the corporation an instrumentality or agency of Government. Specifically, if a department of Government is transferred to a corporation, it would be a strong factor supportive of the inference."" These observations of the court in the International Airport Authority's case (supra) have our full approval. The tests for determining as to when a corporation can be said to be a instrumentality or agency of Government may now be called out from the judgment in the International Airport Authority's case. These tests are not conclusive or clinching, but they are merely indicative indicia which have to be used with care and caution, because while stressing the necessity of a wide meaning to be placed on the expression ""other authorities"", it must be realised that it should not be stretched so far as to bring in every autonomous body which has some nexus with the Government within the sweep of the expression. A wide enlargement of the meaning must be tempered by a wise limitation. We may summarise the relevant tests gathered from the decision in the International Airport Authority's case as follows (1) ""One thing is clear that if the entire share capital of the corporation is held by Government it would go a long way towards indicating that the corporation is an instrumentality or agency of Government."" (2) ""Where the financial assistance of the State is so much as to meet almost entire expenditure of the corporation, it would afford some indication of the corporation being impregnated with governmental character."" (3) ""It may also be a relevant factor.......whether the corporation enjoys monopoly status which is the State conferred or State protected."" (4) ""Existence of deep and pervasive State control may afford an indication that the Corporation is a State agency or instrumentality."" (5) ""If the functions of the corporation of public importance and closely related to governmental functions, it would be a relevant factor in classifying the corporation as an instrumentality or agency of Government."" Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 18 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 (6) ""Specifically, if a department of Government is transferred to a corporation, it would be a strong factor supportive of this inference of the corporation being an instrumentality or agency of Government."" If on a consideration of these relevant factors it is found that the corporation is an instrumentality or agency of government, it would, as pointed out in the International Airport Authority's case, be an 'authority' and, therefore, 'State' within the meaning of the expression in Article 12. We find that the same view has been taken by Chinnappa Reddy, J. in a subsequent decision of this court in the U. P. Warehousing Corporation v. Vijay Narain and the observations made by the learned Judge in that case strongly reinforced the view we are taking particularly in the matrix of our constitutional system. We may point out that it is immaterial for this purpose whether the corporation is created by a statute or under a statute. The test is whether it is an instrumentality or agency of the Government and not as to how it is created. The inquiry has to be not as to how the juristic person is born but why it has been brought into existence. The corporation may be a statutory corporation created by a statute or it may be a Government Company or a company formed under the Companies Act, 1956 or it may be a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 or any other similar statute. Whatever be its genetical origin, it would be an ""authority"" within the meaning of Article 12 if it is an instrumentality or agency of the Government and that would have to be decided on a proper assessment of the facts in the light of the relevant factors. The concept of instrumentality or agency of the Government is not limited to a corporation created by a statute but is equally applicable to a company or society and in a given case it would have to be decided, on a consideration of the relevant factors, whether the company or society is an instrumentality or agency of the Government so as to come within the meaning of the expression ""authority"" in Article 12. It is also necessary to add that merely because a juristic entity may be an ""authority"" and therefore ""State"" within the meaning of Article 12, it may not be elevated to the position of ""State"" for the purpose of Articles 309, 310 and 311 which find a place in Part XIV. The definition of ""State"" in Article 12 which includes an ""authority"" within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India is limited in its application only to Part III and by virtue of Article 36, to Part IV: it does not extend to the other provisions of the Constitution and hence a juristic entity which may be ""State"" for the purpose of Parts III and IV would not be so for the purpose of Part XIV or any other provision of the Constitution. That is why the decisions of this Court in S. L. Aggarwal v. Hindustan Steel Ltd. and other cases involving the applicability of Article 311 have no relevance to the issue before us. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents Nos. 6 to 8, however, relied strongly on the decision in Sabhajit Tewary v. Union of India & Ors(2) and contended that this decision laid down in no uncertain terms that a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 can never be regarded as an ""authority"" within the meaning of Article 12. This being a decision given by a Bench of five Judges of this Court is undoubtedly binding upon us but we do not think it lays down any such proposition as is contended on behalf of the respondents. The question which arose in this case was as to whether the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research which was juridically a Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 19 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 was an ""authority"" within the meaning of Article 12. The test which the Court applied for determining this question was the same as the one laid down in the International Airport Authority's case and approved by us, namely, whether the Council was an instrumentality or agency of the Government. The Court implicitly assented to the proposition that if the Council were an agency of the Government, it would undoubtedly be an ""authority"". But, having regard to the various features enumerated in the judgment, the Court held that the Council was not an agency of the Government and hence could not be regarded as an ""authority"". The Court did not rest its conclusion on the ground that the Council was a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, but proceeded to consider various other features of the Council for arriving at the conclusion that it was not an agency of the Government and therefore not an ""authority"". This would have been totally unnecessary if the view of the Court were that a society registered under the Societies Registration Act can never be an ""authority"" within the meaning of Article 12. The decision in Sukhdev Singh v. Bhagat Ram (1975) 3 SCR 619 was also strongly relied upon by the learned counsel for respondents Nos. 6 to 8 but we fail to see how this decision can assist the respondents in repelling the reasoning in the International Airport Authority's case or contending that a company or society formed under a statute can never come within the meaning of the expression ""authority"" in Article 12. That was a case relating to three juristic bodies, namely, the Oil and Natural Gas Commission, the Industrial Finance Corporation and the Life Insurance Corporation and the question was whether they were ""State"" under Article 12. Each of these three juristic bodies was a corporation created by a statute and the Court by majority held that they were ""authorities"" and therefore ""State"" within the meaning of Article 12. The Court in this case was not concerned with the question whether a company or society formed under a statute can be an ""authority"" or not and this decision does not therefore contain anything which might even remotely suggest that such a company or society can never be an ""authority"". On the contrary, the thrust of the logic in the decision, far from being restrictive, applies to all juristic persons alike, irrespective whether they are created by a statute or formed under a statute. It is in the light of this discussion that we must now proceed to examine whether the Society in the present case is an ""authority"" falling within the definition of ""State"" in Article 12. Is it an instrumentality or agency of the Government? The answer must obviously be in the affirmative if we have regard to the Memorandum of Association and the Rules of the Society. The composition of the Society is dominated by the representatives appointed by the Central Government and the Governments of Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh with the approval of the Central Government. The monies required for running the college are provided entirely by the Central Government and the Government of Jammu & Kashmir and even if any other monies are to be received by the Society, it can be done only with the approval of the State and the Central Governments. The Rules to be made by the Society are also required to have the prior approval of the State and the Central Governments and the accounts of the Society have also to be submitted to both the Governments for their scrutiny and satisfaction. The Society is also to comply with all such directions as may be issued by the State Government with the approval of the Central Government in respect of any matters dealt with in the report of the Reviewing Committee. The control of the State and the Central Governments is indeed so deep and pervasive that no immovable property of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 20 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 the Society can be disposed of in any manner without the approval of both the Governments. The State and the Central Governments have even the power to appoint any other person or persons to be members of the Society and any member of the Society other than a member representing the State or the Central Government can be removed from the membership of the Society by the State Government with the approval of the Central Government. The Board of Governors, which is in charge of general superintendence, direction and control of the affairs of Society and of its income and property is also largely controlled by nominees of the State and the Central Governments. It will thus be seen that the State Government and by reason of the provision for approval, the Central Government also, have full control of the working of the Society and it would not be incorrect to say that the Society is merely a projection of the State and the Central Governments and to use the words of Ray, C.J. in Sukhdev Singh's case (supra), the voice is that of the State and the Central Governments and the hands are also of the State and the Central Governments. We must, therefore, hold that the Society is an instrumentality or agency of the State and the Central Governments and it is an 'authority' within the meaning of Art. 12. If the Society is an ""authority"" and therefore ""State"" within the meaning of Article 12, it must follow that it is subject to the constitutional obligation under Article 14. The true scope and ambit of Article 14 has been the subject matter of numerous decisions and it is not necessary to make any detailed reference to them. It is sufficient to state that the content and reach of Article 14 must not be confused with the doctrine of classification. Unfortunately, in the early stages of the evolution of our constitutional law, Article 14 came to be identified with the doctrine of classification because the view taken was that Article forbids discrimination and there would be no discrimination where the classification making the differentia fulfils two conditions, namely, (i) that the classification is founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group; and (ii) that differentia has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the impugned legislative or executive action. It was for the first time in E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu that this Court laid bare a new dimension of Article 14 and pointed out that Article has highly activist magnitude and it embodies a guarantee against arbitrariness. This Court speaking through one of us (Bhagwati, J.) said : ""The basic principle which therefore informs both Articles 14 and 16 is equality and inhibition against discrimination. Now, what is the content and reach of this great equalising principle ? It is a founding faith, to use the words of Bose, J., ""a way of life"", and it must not be subjected to a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach. We cannot countenance any attempt to truncate its all-embracing scope and meaning, for to do so would be to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be ""cribbled, cabined and confined"" within traditional and doctrinaire limits. From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness. In fact, equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other, to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where an act is arbitrary it is implicit in it that it is unequal both according to political logic and constitutional law and is therefore violative of Art. 14, and if it affects any matter relating to public employment, it is also violative of Art. 16. Articles 14 and 16 strike at arbitrariness in State action and Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 21 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 ensure fairness and equality of treatment."" This vital and dynamic aspect which was till then lying latent and submerged in the few simple but pregnant words of Article 14 was explored and brought to light in Royappa's case and it was reaffirmed and elaborated by this Court in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India where this Court again speaking through one of us (Bhagwati, J.) observed : ""Now the question immediately arises as to what is the requirement of Article 14 : what is the content and reach of the great equalising principle enunciated is this article ? There can be no doubt that it is a founding faith of the Constitution. It is indeed the pillar on which rests securely the foundation of our democratic republic. And, therefore, it must not be subjected to a narrow, pedantic or lexicographic approach. No attempt should be made to truncate its all-embracing scope and meaning for, to do so would be to violate its activist magnitude. Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and doctrinaire limits...............Article 14 strikes at arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment. The principle of reasonableness, which legally as well as philosophically, is an essential element of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades Article 14 like a brooding omnipresence."" This was again reiterated by this Court in International Airport Authority's case (supra) at page 1042 of the Report. It must therefore now be taken to be well settled that what Article 14 strikes at is arbitrariness because any action that is arbitrary, must necessarily involve negation of equality. The doctrine of classification which is evolved by the courts is not para-phrase of Article 14 nor is it the objective and end of that Article. It is merely a judicial formula for determining whether the legislative or executive action in question is arbitrary and therefore constituting denial of equality. If the classification is not reasonable and does not satisfy the two conditions referred to above, the impugned legislative or executive action would plainly be arbitrary and the guarantee of equality under Article 14 would be breached. Wherever therefore there is arbitrariness in State action whether it be of the legislature or of the executive or of ""authority"" under Article 12, Article 14 immediately springs into action and strikes down such State action. In fact, the concept of reasonableness and non- arbitrariness pervades the entire constitutional scheme and is a golden thread which runs though the whole of the fabric of the Constitution. We may now turn to the merits of the controversy between the parties. Though several contentions were urged in the writ petitions, challenging the validity of the admissions made to the college, they were not all pressed before us and the principal contention that was advanced was that the society acted arbitrarily in the matter of granting of admissions, first by ignoring the marks obtained by the candidates at the qualifying examination; secondly by relying on viva voce examination as a test for determining comparative merit of the candidates; thirdly by allocating as many as 50 marks for the viva voce examination as against 100 marks allocated for the written test and lastly, by holding superficial interviews lasting only 2 or 3 minutes on an average and asking questions which had no relevance to assessment of the suitability of the candidates with reference to the four factors required to be considered at the viva voce examination. Now so far as the challenge on the first Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 22 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 count is concerned, we do not think it is at all well-founded. It is difficult to appreciate how a procedure for admission which does not take into account the marks obtained at the qualifying examination, but prefers to test the comparative merit of the candidates by insisting on an entrance examination can ever be said to be arbitrary. It has been pointed out in the counter affidavit filed by H. L. Chowdhury on behalf of the college that there are two universities on two different dates and the examination by the Board of Secondary Education for Jammu is also held on a different date than the examination by the Board of Secondary Education for Kashmir and the results of these examinations are not always declared before the admissions to the college can be decided. The College being the only institution for education in engineering courses in the State of Jammu & Kashmir has to cater to the needs of both the regions and it has, therefore, found it necessary and expedient to regulate admissions by holding an entrance test, so that the admission process may not be held up on account of late declaration of results of the qualifying examination in either of the two regions. The entrance test also facilitates the assessment of the comparative talent of the candidates by application of a uniform standard and is always preferable to evaluation of comparative merit on the basis of marks obtained at the qualifying examination, when the qualifying examination is held by two or more different authorities, because lack of uniformity is bound to creep into the assessment of candidates by different authorities with different modes of examination. We would not, therefore, regard the procedure adopted by the society as arbitrary merely because it refused to take into account the marks obtained by the candidates at the qualifying examination, but chose to regulate the admissions by relying on the entrance test. The second ground of challenge questioned the validity of viva voce examination as a permissible test for selection of candidates for admission to a college. The contention of the petitioners under this ground of challenge was that viva voce examination does not afford a proper criterion for assessment of the suitability of the candidates for admission and it is a highly subjective and impressionistic test where the result is likely to be influenced by many uncertain and imponderable factors such as predelictions and prejudices of the interviewers, his attitudes and approaches, his pre-conceived notions and idiosyncrasies and it is also capable of abuse because it leaves scope for discrimination, manipulation and nepotism which can remain undetected under the cover of an interview and moreover it is not possible to assess the capacity and calibre of a candidate in the course of an interview lasting only for a few minutes and, therefore, selections made on the basis of oral interview must be regarded as arbitrary and hence violative of Art. 14. Now this criticism cannot be said to be wholly unfounded and it reflects a point of view which has certainly some validity. We may quote the following passage from the book on ""Public Administration in Theory and Practice"" by M. P. Sharma which voices a far and balanced criticism of the oral interview method : ""The oral test of the interview has been much criticised on the ground of its subjectivity and uncertainty. Different interviews have their own notions of good personality. For some, it consists more in attractive physical appearance and dress rather than anything else, and with them the breezy and shiny type of candidate scores highly while the rough uncut diamonds may go unappreciated. The atmosphere of the interview is artificial and prevents some candidates from appearing at their best. Its duration is short, the few questions of the hit-or-miss type, which are put, may fail to reveal the real worth of the candidate. It has been said Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 23 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 that God takes a whole life time to judge a man's worth while interviewers have to do it in a quarter of an hour. Even at it's best, the common sort of interview reveals but the superficial aspects of the candidate's personality like appearance, speaking power, and general address. Deeper traits of leadership, tact, forcefulness, etc. go largely undetected. The interview is often in the nature of desultory conversation. Marking differs greatly from examiner to examiner. An analysis of the interview results show that the marks awarded to candidates who competed more than once for the same service vary surprisingly. All this shows that there is a great element of chance in the interview test. This becomes a serious matter when the marks assigned to oral test constitute a high proportion of the total marks in the competition. 01 Glenn Stahl points out in his book on ""Public Personnel Administration"" that there are three disadvantages from which the oral test method suffers, namely, ""(1) the difficulty of developing valid and reliable oral tests; (2) the difficulty of securing a reviewable record on an oral test; and (3) public suspicion of the oral test as a channel for the exertion of political influence"" and we may add, other corrupt, nepotistic or extraneous considerations. The learned author then proceeds to add in a highly perceptive and critical passage : ""The oral examination has failed in the past in direct proportion to the extent of its misuse. It is a delicate instrument and, in inexpert hands, a dangerous one. The first condition of its successful use is the full recognition of its limitations. One of the most prolific sources of error in the oral has been the failure on the part of examiners to understand the nature of evidence and to discriminate between that which was relevant, material and reliable and that which was not. It also must be remembered that the best oral interview provides opportunity for analysis of only a very small part of a person's total behaviour. Generalizations from a single interview regarding an individual's total personality pattern have been proved repeatedly to be wrong."" But, despite all this criticism, the oral interview method continues to be very much in vogue as a supplementary test for assessing the suitability of candidates wherever test of personal traits is considered essential. Its relevance as a test for determining suitability based on personal characteristics has been recognised in a number of decisions of this Court which are binding upon us. In the first case on the point which came before this Court, namely, R. Chitra Lekha and Others v. State of Mysore and Others this Court pointed out : ""In the field of education there are divergent views as regards the mode of testing the capacity and calibre of students in the matter of admissions to colleges. Orthodox educationists stand by the marks obtained by a student in the annual examination. The modern trend of opinion insists upon other additional tests, such as interview, performance in extra- curricular activities, personality test, psychiatric tests etc. Obviously we are not in a position to judge which method is preferable or which test is the correct one.................................................... ..... The scheme of selection, however, perfect it may be on paper, may be abused in practice. That it is capable of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 24 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 abuse is not a ground for quashing it. So long as the order lays down relevant objective criteria and entrusts the business of selection to quali- fied persons, this Court cannot obviously have any say in the matter. and on this view refused to hold the oral interview test as irrelevant or arbitrary. It was also pointed out by this Court in A. Peeriakaruppan v. State of Tamil Nadu & Ors : ""In most cases, the first impression need not necessarily be the past impression, but under the existing conditions, we are unable to accede to the contentions of the petitioners that the system of interview as in vogue in this country is so defective as to make it useless."" It is therefore not possible to accept the contentions of the petitioners that the oral interview test is so defective that selecting candidates for admission on the basis of oral interview in addition to written test must be regarded as arbitrary. The oral interview test is undoubtedly not a very satisfactory test for assessing and evaluating the capacity and calibre of candidates, but in the absence of any better test for measuring personal characteristics and traits, the oral interview test must, at the present stage, be regarded as not irrational or irrelevant though it is subjective and based on first impression, its result is influenced by many uncertain factors and it is capable of abuse. We would, however, like to point out that in the matter of admission to college or even in the matter of public employment, the oral interview test as presently held should not be relied upon as an exclusive test, but it may be resorted to only as an additional or supplementary test and, moreover, great care must be taken to see that persons who are appointed to conduct the oral interview test are men of high integrity, calibre and qualification. So far as the third ground of challenge is concerned, we do not think it can be dismissed as unsubstantial. The argument of the petitioners under this head of challenge was that even if oral interview may be regarded in principle as a valid test for selection of candidates for admission to a college, it was in the present case arbitrary and unreasonable since the marks allocated for the oral interview were very much on the higher side as compared with the marks allocated for the written test. The marks allocated for the oral interview were 50 as against 100 allocated for the written test, so that the marks allocated for the oral interview came to 33 1/3% of the total number of marks taken into account for the purpose of making the selection. This, contended the petitioners, was beyond all reasonable proportion and rendered the selection of the candidates arbitrary and violative of the equality clause of the Constitution. Now there can be no doubt that, having regard to the drawbacks and deficiencies in the oral interview test and the conditions prevailing in the country, particularly when there is deterioration in moral values and corruption and nepotism are very much on the increase, allocation of a high percentage of marks for the oral interview as compared to the marks allocated for the written test, cannot be accepted by the Court as free from the vice of arbitrariness. It may be pointed out that even in Peeriakaruppan's case (supra), where 75 marks out of a total of 275 marks were allocated for the oral interview, this Court observed that the marks allocated for interview were on the high-side. This Court also observed in Miss Nishi Maghu's Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 25 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 case (supra): ""Reserving 50 marks for interview out of a total of 150... does seem excessive, especially when the time spent was not more than 4 minutes on each candidate"". There can be no doubt that allocating 33 1/3 of the total marks for oral interview is plainly arbitrary and unreasonable. It is significant to note that even for selection of candidates for the Indian Administrative Service, the Indian Foreign Service and the Indian Police Service, where the personality of the candidate and his personal characteristics and traits are extremely relevant for the purpose of selection, the marks allocated for oral interview are 250 as against 1800 marks for the written examination, constituting only 12.2% of the total marks taken into consideration for the purpose of making the selection. We must, therefore, regard the allocation of as high a percentage as 33 1/3 of the total marks for the oral interview as infecting the admission procedure with the vice of arbitrariness and selection of candidates made on the basis of such admission procedure cannot be sustained. But we do not think we would be justified in the exercise of our discretion in setting aside the selections made for the academic year 1979-80 after the lapse of a period of about 18 months, since to do so would be to cause immense hardship to those students in whose case the validity of the selection cannot otherwise be questioned and who have nearly completed three semesters and, moreover, even if the petitioners are ultimately found to be deserving of selection on the application of the proper test, it would not be possible to restore them to the position as if they were admitted for the academic year 1979-80, which has run out long since. It is true there is an allegation of mala fides against the Committee which interviewed the candidates and we may concede that if this allegation were established, we might have been inclined to interfere with the selections even after the lapse of a period of 18 months, because the writ petitions were filed as early as October-November, 1979 and merely because the Court could not take-up the hearing of the writ petitions for such a long time should be no ground for denying relief to the petitioners, if they are otherwise so entitled. But we do not think that on the material placed before us we can sustain the allegation of mala fides against the Committee. It is true, and this is a rather disturbing feature of the present cases, that a large number of successful candidates succeeded in obtaining admission to the college by virtue of very high marks obtained by them at the viva voce examination tilted the balance in their favour, though the marks secured by them at the qualifying examination were much less than those obtained by the petitioners and even in the written test, they had fared much worse than the petitioners. It is clear from the chart submitted to us on behalf of the petitioners that the marks awarded at the interview are by and large in inverse proportion to the marks obtained by the candidates at the qualifying examination and are also, in a large number of cases, not commensurate with the marks obtained in the written test. The chart does create a strong suspicion in our mind that the marks awarded at the viva voce examination might have been manipulated with a view to favouring the candidates who ultimately came to be selected, but suspicion cannot take the place of proof and we cannot hold the plea of mala fides to be established. We need much more cogent material before we can hold that the Committee deliberately manipulated the marks at the viva voce examination with a view to favouring certain candidates as against the petitioners. We cannot, however, fail to mention that this is a matter which required to be looked into very carefully and not only the State Government, but also the Central Government which is equally responsible for the proper running of the college, must take care to see that proper persons are appointed on the interviewing committees and there is no executive interference with their decision-making process. We may also caution the authorities that though, in the present case, for reasons which we have already given, we are not interfering with the selection for the academic year 1979- 80, the selections Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 26 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 made for the subsequent academic years would run the risk of invalidation if such a high percentage of marks is allocated for the oral interview. We are of the view that, under the existing circumstances, allocation of more than 15% of the total marks for the oral interview would be arbitrary and unreasonable and would be liable to be struck down as constitutionally invalid. The petitioners, arguing under the last ground of challenge, urged that the oral interview as conducted in the present case was a mere pretence or farce, as it did not last for more than 2 or 3 minutes per candidate on an average and the questions which were asked were formal questions relating to parentage and residence of the candidate and hardly any question was asked which had relevance to assessment of the suitability of the candidate with reference to any of the four factors required to be considered by the Committee. When the time spent on each candidate was not more 2 or 3 minutes on an average, contended the petitioners, how could the suitability of the candidate be assessed on a consideration of the relevant factors by holding such an interview and how could the Committee possibly judge the merit of the candidate with reference to these factors when no questions bearing on these factors were asked to the candidate. Now there can be no doubt that if the interview did not take more than 2 or 3 minutes on an average and the questions asked had no bearing on the factors required to be taken into account, the oral interview test would be vitiated, because it would be impossible in such an interview to assess the merit of a candidate with reference to these factors. This allegation of the petitioners has been denied in the affidavit in reply filed by H. L. Chowdhury on behalf of the college and it has been stated that each candidate was interviewed for 6 to 8 minutes and ""only the relevant questions on the aforesaid subjects were asked"". If this statement of H. L. Chowdhury is correct, we cannot find much fault with the oral interview test held by the Committee. But we do not think we can act on this statement made by H. L. Chowdhury, because there is nothing to show that he was present at the interviews and none of the three Committee members has come forward to make an affidavit denying the allegation of the petitioners and stating that each candidate was interviewed for 6 to 8 minutes and only relevant questions were asked. We must therefore, proceed on the basis that the interview of each candidate did not last for more than 2 or 3 minutes on an average and hardly any questions were asked having bearing on the relevant factors. If that be so, the oral interview test must be held to be vitiated and the selection made on the basis of such test must be held to be arbitrary. We are, however, not inclined for reasons already given, to set aside the selection made for the academic year 1979-80, though we may caution the State Government and the Society that for the future academic years, selections may be made on the basis of observation made by us in this judgment lest they might run the risk of being struck down. We may point out that, in our opinion, if the marks allocated for the oral interview do not exceed 15% of the total marks and the candidates are properly interviewed and relevant questions are asked with a view to assessing their suitability with reference to the factors required to be taken into consideration, the oral interview test would satisfy the criterion of reasonableness and non-arbitrariness. We think that it would also be desirable if the interview of the candidates is tape-recorded, for in that event there will be contemporaneous evidence to show what were the questions asked to the candidates by the interviewing committee and what were the answers given and that will eliminate a lot of unnecessary controversy besides acting as a check on the possible arbitrariness of the interviewing committee. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1186368/ 27 Ajay Hasia Etc vs Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors. Etc on 13 November, 1980 We may point out that the State Government, the Society and the College have agreed before us that the best fifty students, out of those who applied for admission for the academic year 1979-80 and who have failed to secure admission so far, will be granted admission for the academic year 1981-82 and the seats allocated to them will be in addition to the normal intake of students in the College. We order accordingly. Subject to the above direction, the writ petitions are dismissed, but having regard to the facts and circumstances of the present cases, we think that a fair order of costs would be that each party should bear and pay its own costs of the writ petitions.

HEADNOTE: The respondents were the successful bidders at an auction of forest coupes in the State of Bihar. As they defaulted in making the security deposit in respect of three coupes, the agreements with them were determined by the Conservator of Forests. The respondents thereupon filed a Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/660608/ 1 Advocate General, State Of Bihar vs Madhya Pradesh Khair Industries Ltd on 5 March, 1980 writ petition in the Calcutta High Court instead of in the Patna High Court and followed it up with several applications one after another both in the Calcutta and Patna High Courts towards the forest department from preventing unauthorised removal of forest produce by the respondents. Vexed by the manner in which the respondent was filing repeated applications and procuring orders of a learned single judge of the High Court necessitating the filing of as many appeals to the Division Bench, the State of Bihar moved an application for committing the respondents for contempt of court, alleging that, by their conduct the respondents were obstructing the administration of justice and interfering with the due course of judicial proceedings. The Patna High Court held that the respondent's conduct was most unscrupulous and that there was gross abuse of the process of the Court, which could in certain circumstances amount to contempt of Court. However, the High Court dismissed the application on the ground that it was barred by limitation as it was filed beyond the period of one year prescribed by section 20 of the Contempt of Courts Act. The High Court held, on a reading of the contempt application that the material allegation in regard to the contempt committed by the respondents was that relating to the filing of the application dated April 7, 1971 before the single judge of the Calcutta High Court to circumvent and nullify the order dated March 29, 1971 of the Division Bench of the Patna High Court. As the contempt application dated 18-7-73 in OCM 7/73 was filed more than a year later, it was timeshared. In regard to the allegation relating to the filing of the petition dated December 14, 1972, the High Court observed that there was no specific allegation that any contempt of court was committed by the filing of this application. Though the respondents tendered an unconditional apology, its acceptance was not considered as the application was found to be beyond time. Hence the appeal under section 19 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. Allowing the State appeal, the Court ^ HELD: 1. Every abuse of process of the court may not necessarily amount to contempt of Court. Abuse of process of the Court calculated to hamper the due course of a judicial proceeding or the orderly administration of justice is a contempt of Court. [1178A-B] 2. It may be that certain minor abuses of the process of the court may be suitably dealt with as between the parties by striking out pleadings under the 1173 provisions of order 6, Rule 16 C.P.C. or in some other manner. But on the other hand, it may be necessary to punish as a contempt, a course of conduct which abuses and makes a mockery of the judicial process and which thus extends its pernicious influence beyond the parties to the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/660608/ 2 Advocate General, State Of Bihar vs Madhya Pradesh Khair Industries Ltd on 5 March, 1980 action and affects the interest of the public in the administration of Justice. [1178B-C] 3. The public have an interest, an abiding and a real interest and a vital stake, in the effective and orderly administration of justice, because, unless justice is so administered, there is the peril of all rights and liberties perishing. The Court has the duty of protecting the interest of the public in the administration of justice and, so, it is entrusted with the power to commit for contempt of Court, not in order to protect the dignity of the Court against insult or injury as the expression ""Contempt of Court"" may seem to suggest, but to protect and to vindicate the right of the public that administration of justice shall not be prevented, prejudiced, obstructed or interfered with. [1178C-E] Offutt v. U.S.p.11, quoted with approval. 4. It is not necessary that every allegation made should be followed then and there by the statement that the allegation established a contempt of Court Paragraph 29 of the application to commit the respondents for Contempt expressly referred to the application dated December 14, 1972 and paragraph 31 state that all the facts and circumstances enumerated in the petition established that the respondents were obstructing and interfering with the due course of administration of justice. [1180F-H] In the instant case: (a) the respondents began the ""game"" by filing an application under Art. 226 of the Constitution of India in the Calcutta High Court, whereas in the normal course one would expect such an application to be filed in the Patna High Court within whose jurisdiction the subject matter of dispute was situate. A justifiable prima facie inference from this circumstance may be that the application was not bonafide but intended to harass and oppress the opposite party. [1179C-E] (b) Thereafter application after application was filed before the learned single Judge, everyone of them designed to circumvent, defect or nullify the effect of the orders of the Division Benches of the Calcutta High Court and Patna High Court. The order of the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court directing the respondents to furnish security in a sum of Rs. 1,55,000/- was never complied with. The order of the Division Bench of the Patna High Court directing the respondents to furnish security of immovable property in a sum of Rs. 75,000/- and to deposit in cash or furnish bank guarantee in a sum of Rs. 50,000/- was also never complied with. Instead, an order was obtained from the single Judge of the Calcutta High Court restraining the State of Bihar from continuing the money suit in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Palamau. When this order was set aside by the Division Bench, an attempt was made to circumvent all earlier orders by obtaining an order of the single Judge that they may be allowed to deposit a sum of Rs. 60,000/- in Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/660608/ 3 Advocate General, State Of Bihar vs Madhya Pradesh Khair Industries Ltd on 5 March, 1980 cash and permitted to remove the stock from the forest Coupes. When the State of Bihar moved the learned Subordinate Judge, Palamau for a direction to auction the attached stock, the respondents moved an application on December 14, 1972, and obtained an order from the Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court staying the proceedings in the 1174 money suit in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Palamau. In considering the question whether the filing of the application dated December 14, 1972, amounts to a Contempt of Court, the Court must take into account the whole course of the continuing contumacious conduct of the respondents from the beginning of the 'game'. Clearly, not a single application made to the Single Judge was bonafide. Every application was a daring 'raid' on the Court and each was an abuse of the process of the Court. The application dated December 14, 1972 praying that the proceedings in the money suit in the Court of the Subordinate Judge should be stayed was made despite the fact that earlier, on January 10, 1972 the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court had expressly permitted the proceedings in the money suit to go on. The application of the respondents clearly showed that they were intent upon obstructing the due course of the proceedings in the money suit in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Palamau and to obstruct the administration of justice by abusing the process of the Court. [1179GH, 1180A-E] (c) The application dated December 14, 1972 was an abuse of process of the Court, calculated to obstruct the due course of a judicial proceeding and the administration of justice and was therefore, a criminal contempt of Court; [1180H, 1181A] (d) though the respondents had expressed an unconditional apology to the Patna High Court, the conduct of the respondents is so reprehensible as to warrant condemnation by the imposition of a sentence. [1181A] JUDGMENT: CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 349 of 1974. From the Judgment and order dated 24-4-1974 of the Patna High Court in original Crl. Misc. No. 7/73. Lal Narayan Sinha, Attorney General, U. P. Singh, B. P. Singh and S. N. Jha for the Appellant. Sukumar Ghosh for the Respondent. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/660608/ 4 Advocate General, State Of Bihar vs Madhya Pradesh Khair Industries Ltd on 5 March, 1980 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHINNAPPA REDDY, J. The Advocate-General of Bihar is the appellant in this appeal under Section 19 of the Contempts of Courts Act, 1971. Respondent No. 1, M/s. Madhya Pradesh Khair Industries, represented by respondent No. 2, Om Prakash Agrawal, were the highest bides at an auction held by the Divisional Forest officer, Garhwa South, of four forest coupes in the State of Bihar. Under the terms of the agreements the respondents were required to deposit 25% of each of the four bids as security. The respondents were, however, able to make the deposit in respect of one coupe only and not in respect of the other three coupes. The respondents requested for time. Thereafter, there was a long course of correspondence with which we are not now concerned. Finally, on January 28, 1970, the Conservator of Forests determined the agreements. On February 28, 1970, respondent No. 1 served a notice on the Divisional Forest officer Garhwa South, intimating him that they had filed an application under Article 226 of the Constitution in the Calcutta High Court and that S. C. Deb, J., had been pleased to issue a rule nisi and also an injunction restraining the Govt. of Bihar and the officials of the Forest Department of the Govt. of Bihar from giving effect to the proceedings by which the leases were determined and further directing them to allow M/s. Madhya Pradesh Khair Industries to carry on the work of cutting and felling of trees and removing the material in the said forest coupes. Alleging that the officers of the Forest Department of the Govt. of Bihar had violated the order of injunction granted against them, the respondents filed an application to commit the Officers for Contempt of Court and in that application they prayed for and obtained an interim order directing the Officers not to interfere in any way with the activities of the respondents in removing the produce of the Khair trees. The State of Bihar preferred an appeal to a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court and on September 29,1970, the Division Bench passed an order allowing the appeal and directing the respondents to furnish security in a sum of Rs. 1,55,000 if they desired to remove the forest produce. Otherwise, they were restrained from selling the trees and extracting the produce. The respondents offered certain property as security but that was rejected by the Registrar of the Calcutta High Court as the title was found to be defective. At this stage on January 8, 1971, the State of Bihar filed money suit No. 3 of 1971 in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Palamau to recover a sum of Rs. 1,93,225 as damages. The State of Bihar also filed an application under order 38, Rule 5, Code of Civil Procedure and obtained an order of attachment of the 'Kath' manufactured by the respondents alongwith utensils, equipment, etc. The respondents were directed to furnish security in a sum of Rs. 2 lakhs and asked to show cause why the interim attachment should not be made absolute. The attachment was effected on January 10, 1971. The respondents appeared before the learned Subordinate Judge and requested that the reduced the amount of security from Rs. 2 lakhs to Rs. 75,000. The learned Subordinate Judge allowed the prayer of the respondents and reduced the amount of security from Rs. 2 lakhs to Rs. 75,000. The State of Bihar preferred an appeal to the Patna High Court and an interim order was made by the High Court, staying the operation of the order of the learned Subordinate Judge but continuing the attachment. On March 29, 1971, after hearing both the parties, the Patna High Court made an order directing the respondents to furnish security of immovable property in a sum of Rs. 75,000 and to deposit cash or furnish bank guarantee in a sum of Rs. 50,000. It was directed that on such security being furnished the interim attachment would cease and the respondents would be allowed to remove the stock, utensils and equipment. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/660608/ 5 Advocate General, State Of Bihar vs Madhya Pradesh Khair Industries Ltd on 5 March, 1980 Without complying with the order of the Patna High Court, Respondent No.1 then moved the learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court on April 21, 1971, and obtained an order restraining the State of Bihar from continuing the money suit in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Palamau and further directing the State to take steps to get the attachment vacated if security was furnished by the respondents as directed by the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court. The State of Bihar filed an appeal against the order of the learned Single Judge and the operation of the order was stayed by an order of January 10, 1972 of the Division Bench. It was directed that the proceedings in the money suit in the Court of the learned Subordinate Judge of Palamau should proceed. In the meanwhile on July 30, 1971, Respondent No. 1 moved another application before the learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court offering to deposit Rs. 60,000 in cash and requesting that on such deposit being made, they might be allowed to remove the stock. This application was allowed on July 30, 1971, by the learned Single Judge and the amount was directed to be deposited with the counsel for the State of Bihar. The order was later on modified on December 16, 1972, and the amount was directed to be deposited with the Registrar of the High Court. On November 20, 1972, the State of Bihar filed an application in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Palamau complaining that the respondents had not furnished security as directed by the Patna High Court and as the attached stock was deteriorating it might be sold by auction. Before anything further could be done Respondent No. 1 filed a petition on 14th December, 1972, and obtained an order from the learned Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court on December 18, 1972, staying the proceedings in the money suit in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Palamau until the attached goods were released in compliance with the orders dated July 30, 1971 and February 16, 1972. The State of Bihar preferred an appeal against the order of the learned Single Judge and on January 22, 1973, a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court set aside the order of the learned Single Judge and directed the proceedings in the Court of Subordinate Judge, Palamau, to go on. Vexed by the manner in which the 1st Respondent was filing repeated applications and procuring orders from a learned Single Judge of the High Court, necessitating the filing of as many appeals to the Division Bench, the State of Bihar filed an application for committing the Respondents for Contempt of Court alleging that, by their conduct the respondents were obstructing the administration of justice and interfering with the due course of judicial proceedings. The Patna High Court held that the respondents' conduct was most unscrupulous one that there was gross abuse of the process of the Court, which could in certain circumstances amount to contempt of Court. The High Court, however, dismissed the application on the ground that it was barred by limitation as it was filed beyond the period of one year prescribed by section 20 of the Contempt of Courts Act. The High Court held, on a reading of the Contempt application, that the material allegation in regard to the contempt committed by the respondents was that relating to the filing of the application dated April 7, 1971, before the Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court to circumvent and nullify the order dated March 29, 1971 of the Division Bench of the Patna High Court. As the contempt application was filed more than a year later it was time-barred. In regard to the allegation relating to the filing of the petition dated December 14, 1972, the High Court observed that there was no specific allegation that any Contempt of Court was committed by the filing of this application. We may also mention that the respondents tendered an unconditional apology to the High Court of Bihar. The question of accepting the apology was not considered as the application was found to be beyond time. The Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/660608/ 6 Advocate General, State Of Bihar vs Madhya Pradesh Khair Industries Ltd on 5 March, 1980 Advocate General of Bihar has filed this appeal against the judgment of the Patna High Court. Before we consider the merits of the appeal we may mention here that the learned Single Judge who made the several orders in favour of the respondents was himself compelled in a later order dated August 13, 1973 to state that the respondents had suppressed material facts and misled him on various occasions and obtained orders from him. Section 2(c) of the Contempt of Courts Act defines Criminal contempt as follows: ""(c) 'Criminal Contempt' means the publication (whether by words, spoken or written, or any signs, or by visible representations, or otherwise) of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever which- (i) scandalises or tends to scandalise, or lowers or tends to lower the authority of any court; or (ii) prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with, the due course of any judicial proceeding; or (iii) Interferes or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends to obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner"". While we are conscious that every abuse of the process of the Court may not necessarily amount to Contempt of Court, abuse of the process of the Court calculated to hamper the due course of a judicial proceeding or the orderly administration of justice, we must say, is a contempt of Court. It may be that certain minor abuses of the process of the Court may be suitably dealt with as between the parties, by striking out pleadings under the provisions of order 6, Rule 16 or in some other manner. But, on the other hand, it may be necessary to punish as a contempt, a course of conduct which abuses and makes a mockery of the judicial process and which thus extends its pernicious influence beyond the parties to the action and affects the interest of the public in the administration of justice. The publice have an interest, an abiding and a real interest, and a vital stake in the effective and orderly administration of justice, because, unless justice is so administered, there is the peril of all rights and liberties perishing. The Court has the duty of protecting the interest of the public in the due administration of justice and, so, it is entrusted with the power to commit for Contempt of Court, not in order to protect the dignity of the Court against insult or injury as the expression ""Contempt of Court"" may seem to suggest, but, to protect and to vindicate the right of the public that the administration of justice shall not be prevented, prejudiced, obstructed or interfered with. ""It is a mode of vindicating the majesty of law, in its active manifestation against obstruction and outrage"".(1) ""The law should not be seen to sit by limply, while those who defy it go free, and those who seek its protection lose hope"".(2) In Halsbury's Laws of England (4th Edn-Vol. 9, paragraph 38), there is a brief discussion of when abuse of the process of the Court may be a punishable contempt. It is said: Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/660608/ 7 Advocate General, State Of Bihar vs Madhya Pradesh Khair Industries Ltd on 5 March, 1980 ""38. Abuse of process in general. The Court has power to punish as contempt any misuse of the court's process. Thus the forging or altering off court documents and other deceits of like kind are punishable as serious contempts. Similarly, deceiving the court or the court's officers by deliberately suppressing a fact, or giving false facts, may be a punishable contempt. Certain acts of a lesser nature may also constitute an abuse of process as, for instance, initiating or carrying on proceedings which are wanting in bona fides or which are frivolous, vexatious, or oppressive. In such cases the court has extensive alternative powers to prevent an abuse of its process by striking out or staying proceedings or by prohibiting the taking of further proceedings without leave. Where the court, by exercising its statutory powers, its powers under rules of court, or its inherent jurisdiction, can give an adequate remedy, it will not in general punish the abuse as a contempt of court. On the other hand, where an irregularity or misuse of process amounts to an offence against justice, extending its influence beyond the parties to the action, it may be punished as a contempt"". In the present case, the respondents began 'the game' by filing an application under Art. 226 of the Constitution in the Calcutta High Court, whereas in the normal course one would expect such as application to be filed in the Patna High Court within whose jurisdiction the subject matter of the dispute was situate. For some mysterious reasons which nobody has been able to explain to us, the writ application was filed in the Calcutta High Court. A justifiable prima facie inference from this circumstance may be that the application was not bona fide but intended to harass and oppress the opposite parties. We do not want to say anything more about this aspect of the case as we are told that this is a failing of the respondents which they shared with several others. Perhaps, as we had occasion to remark during the course of the hearing, some parties are unable to reconcile themselves to the fact that the Calcutta High Court has long since ceased to have jurisdiction over the area comprising the State of Bihar which it had several decades ago. The 'game' proceeded further. Application after application was filed before the learned Single Judge, everyone of them designed to circumvent, defeat or nullify the effect of the orders of the Division Benches of the Calcutta High Court and the Patna High Court. The order of the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court directing the respondents to furnish security in a sum of Rs. 1,55,000 was never complied with. The order of the Division Bench of the Patna High Court directing the respondents to furnish security of immovable property in a sum of Rs. 75,000 and to deposit cash or furnish bank guarantee in a sum of Rs. 50,000 was also never complied with. Instead, an order was obtained from the Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court restraining the State of Bihar from continuing the money-suit in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Palamau. When this order was set aside by the Division Bench, an attempt was made to circumvent all earlier orders by obtaining an order from the Single Judge that they may be allowed to deposit Rs. 60,000 in cash and permitted to remove the stock from the forest coupes. When the State of Bihar moved the learned Subordinate Judge, Palamau for a direction to auction the attached stock, the respondents moved an application on December 14, 1972, and obtained an order from the Single Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/660608/ 8 Advocate General, State Of Bihar vs Madhya Pradesh Khair Industries Ltd on 5 March, 1980 Judge of the Calcutta High Court staying the proceedings in the money suit in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Palamau. In considering the question whether the filing of the application dated December 14, 1972, amount to a Contempt of Court, the Court must take into account the whole course of the continuing contumacious conduct of the respondents from the beginning of the ""game"". Clearly, not a single application made to the Single Judge was bona fide. Every application was a daring 'raid' on the Court and each was an abuse of the process of the Court. The application dated December 14, 1972 praying that the proceedings in the money suit in the Court of the Subordinate Judge should be stayed was made despite the fact that earlier, on January 10, 1972, the Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court had expressly permitted the proceedings in the money suit to go on. The application of the respondents clearly showed that they were intent upon obstructing the due course of the proceedings in the money suit in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Palamau and to obstruct the administration of justice by abusing the process of the Court. The High Court expressed the view that there was no specific allegation that any contempt of Court had been committed by the filing of the application dated December 14, 1972. We are unable to agree with the view of the High Court. Paragraph 29 of the application to commit the respondents for Contempt expressly refers to the application dated December 14, 1972 and paragraph 31 states that all the facts and circumstances enumerated in the petition established that the respondents were obstructing and interfering with the due course and administration of justice. It was not necessary that every allegation made should be followed then and there by the statement that the allegation established a Contempt of Court. We are satisfied that the filing of the application dated December 14, 1972, was an abuse of the process of the Court, calculated to obstruct the due course of a judicial proceeding and the administration of justice and was, therefore, a Criminal Contempt of Court. The respondents had expressed an unconditional apology to the Patna High Court, but we are convinced that the conduct of the respondents is so reprehensible as to warrant condemnation by the imposition of a sentence. We accordingly allow the appeal and sentence each of the respondents to pay a fine of Rs. 500/-, in default to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of two weeks. V.D.K. Appeal allowed.

OF 2024 (Arising out of SLP(C) No.10996 of 2018) BABY SAKSHI GREOLA …APPELLANTS(S) VERSUS MANZOOR AHMAD SIMON AND ANOTHER …RESPONDENT(S) JUDGMENT B.R. GAVAI, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. The present appeal calls into question the correctness and validity of the final judgment and order passed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi dated 7th November 2017 in MAC. APP. 1107/2011. 3. The appellant had approached the High Court seeking enhancement of the compensation awarded on account of injuries suffered in a motor vehicle accident. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Central District, Delhi (hereinafter referred to as “Tribunal”) had by a judgment and order dated 13th June 2011 awarded compensation of Rs. 5,90,750/- along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition. The learned Single Judge of the High Court, vide impugned judgment and order, disposed of the appeal filed by the appellant seeking enhancement by granting a further amount of Rs. 5,60,000/- along with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of filing till realization. Aggrieved thereby, the appellant has approached this Court. 4. The facts, in brief, giving rise to the present appeal are as follows: Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49053501/ 1 Baby Sakshi Greola vs Manzoor Ahmad Simon on 11 December, 2024 4.1 On 2nd June, 2009, the appellant, aged seven years, was going on foot along with her mother and brother to her house from National Bal Bhawan, Kotla Road, New Delhi. At about 01:00 PM, when they reached a red light on Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg and Vishnu Digambar Marg, ITO, Delhi, and were crossing the road on a zebra crossing, a car bearing Registration No. DL-3C-AX-1502 being driven at a high speed, hit the appellant, as a result of which, she sustained grievous injuries. 4.2 On 3rd September 2009, the appellant, through her father, filed a claim petition for grant of compensation under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as “MV Act”), before the learned Tribunal against the driver-cum- owner of the offending vehicle and United India Insurance Company Limited, New Delhi arrayed as Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 respectively. 4.3 The learned Tribunal framed three issues for its consideration. First, whether the appellant had suffered grievous injuries on account of the road accident on 2nd June 2009, due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle by Respondent No. 1. Second, whether the appellant is entitled to any compensation, if so, to what amount and from whom. Third, as to what relief should be granted to the appellant. 4.4 The appellant got examined five witnesses in support of her claim. Respondent No. 1 was proceeded ex-parte and Respondent No. 2 did not lead any evidence. 4.5 The learned Tribunal, on appreciation of the evidence, decided the first two issues in favour of the appellant. The learned Tribunal held the respondents jointly and severally liable to make the payment of compensation to the appellant. 4.6 The appellant was awarded the following compensation: S. No. Head Amount (In (cid:131)) 1. Medicines and Medical Treatment 32,000/- 2. Loss of Earning Capacity due to 1,68,750/- Disability 3. Pain and Suffering 50,000 4. Future Treatment 30,000/- 5.

Conveyance and Special Diet 20,000/- Total 5,90,750/- 4.7 Vide judgment and order dated 13th June 2011, the learned Tribunal, therefore, held that the appellant is entitled to a compensation of Rs. 5,90,750/-. The appellant was also held entitled to interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition i.e. 3rd September Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49053501/ 2 Baby Sakshi Greola vs Manzoor Ahmad Simon on 11 December, 2024 2009. 4.8 Seeking enhancement of the compensation awarded by the learned Tribunal, the appellant approached the High Court. 4.9 The learned Single Judge of the High Court, on appreciation of the material placed on record, enhanced the compensation as follows (in bold): S. No. Head Amount (In (cid:131)) 1. Medicines and Medical 32,000/- Treatment 2. Loss of Earning Capacity due 1,68,750/- to Disability 3. Pain and Suffering 50,000 + 50,000 = 1,00,000/- 4. Future Treatment 30,000/- 5. Attendant Charges 15,000 + 4,10,000 = 4,25,000/- 6. Loss of Amenities of Life 1,00,000/- 7. Loss of Future Prospect 1,00,000/- 8. Special Education Expenditure 75,000/- 9. Conveyance and Special Diet 20,000/- 10. Loss of Marriage Prospects 1,00,000/- Total 5,90,750 + 5,60,000 = 11,51,000/- 4.10 Vide impugned judgment and order dated 7th November 2017, the learned Single Judge of the High Court, therefore, enhanced the compensation by Rs.5,60,000/- to Rs.11,51,000/- along with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till realization. 4.11 Challenging the compensation awarded by the High Court, the appellant has filed the present appeal. 5. We have heard Smt. Aruna Mehta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant and Shri Ravi Bakshi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of Respondent No. 2 (United India Insurance Company Limited). 6. Smt. Mehta submitted that the compensation awarded by the Tribunal as enhanced by the High Court deserves reconsideration by this Court. Placing reliance on the evidence of Dr. Monica Juneja (PW-3) who examined the appellant, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant has sustained 75% mental moderate retardation and has no control over the passage of her urine. Further, it is submitted that the disability of the appellant is in relation to the whole body and is non-progressive. She submitted that children with moderate mental retardation are generally able to learn skills up to the level of a child of 2nd standard/class as adults and can work under close supervision only. She further submitted that, the appellant will require close supervision of an attendant for her day-to-day work. She further submitted that the appellant would need admission in a special school or training by a special education teacher and that due to her condition, the appellant’s marriage prospects may be severely affected. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49053501/ 3 Baby Sakshi Greola vs Manzoor Ahmad Simon on 11 December, 2024 7. Smt. Mehta submitted that, taking into consideration the condition of the appellant, the High Court has erred in granting only Rs. 4,25,000/- towards the attendant charges by taking minimum wages of unskilled worker (Rs. 3,934/- per month) for a part time attendant. She further submitted that, the High Court has failed to award suitable amount of compensation under the head pain and suffering, as well as for future medical treatment of the appellant. 8. The learned counsel for the appellant has placed reliance on three judgments of this Court viz. Kajal v. Jagdish Chand and Others1, Master Ayush v. Branch Manager, Reliance General Insurance Company Limited and Another2 and K.S. Muralidhar v. R. Subbulakshmi and Another3. 9. Per contra, Shri Bakshi, learned counsel appearing for Respondent No. 2 (Insurance Company) submitted that the High Court has rightly followed the settled principles of law and increased the compensation. He submitted that the High Court has been very liberal in awarding an additional sum of Rs.5,60,000/- over and above the amount awarded by the Tribunal. 10. Placing reliance on the Disability Certificate dated 10th January 2011, the learned counsel for Respondent No. 2 submitted that there is a likelihood of improvement in the condition of the appellant. He therefore, submitted that, this Court should not interfere with the amount awarded by the High Court. 1 (2020) 4 SCC 413 : 2020 INSC 135 2 (2022) 7 SCC 738 : 2022 INSC 363 3 2024 SCC OnLine SC 3385 : 2024 INSC 886 11. To consider the present case, it would be appropriate to refer to the evidence of Smt. Prakashi Devi (PW-2), mother of the appellant, who had the misfortune to recount the incident before the Tribunal. It is stated by Smt. Prakashi Devi (PW-2) that on 2nd June 2009 when she was going back from National Bal Bhawan to her home, along with her children on foot, they had to cross the road. When they were crossing the road, on a zebra crossing meant for pedestrians, a Tata Safari car bearing registration number DL-3C-AX-4502, driven by Respondent No.1, at a very high speed, hit her daughter (appellant/Baby Sakshi) with great force as a result of which her daughter sustained grievous injuries to her brain, sustained fracture over left side of femur and lacerated injuries all over her body. 12. Smt. Prakashi Devi (PW-2) stated that her daughter has become permanently partially disabled from her skull area. Further, her daughter cannot enjoy her life like a normal person and cannot walk properly. The prospect of her marriage has been ruined due to the unfortunate accident. Her daughter will not get any government job in her remaining life. Thus, life has become just like hell for her and her daughter will have to suffer trauma and loss of amenities of life. 13. It was also stated by the mother of the appellant (PW-2), that she wanted to make her daughter a badminton player but all her hopes have now vanished due to the unfortunate accident. It was stated by her that the appellant was a brilliant student and had she not met with the accident, she would have got a job of at least Rs. 25,000-30,000/- per month, but as a result of the accident she has become a dull student. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49053501/ 4 Baby Sakshi Greola vs Manzoor Ahmad Simon on 11 December, 2024 14. It would also be appropriate to refer to the evidence of Dr. Monica Juneja (PW-3), who proved the Disability Certificate dated 10th January 2011. As per the said certificate, the appellant has suffered 75% disability, which is permanent in nature on account of moderate mental retardation. This disability is in relation to the whole body, which is non- progressive. It is stated in the certificate that this is a case of road traffic accident with Subarachnoid Haemorrhage with healed fracture femur left with moderate mental retardation which means she has an Intelligence Quotient of 41 and social Quotient of 43. 15. It is recorded in the testimony of Dr. Monica Juneja (PW-3) that, children with moderate mental retardation are generally able to learn skills up to the level of 2nd Standard/Class as adults and can work under close supervision only. Further, the appellant also has severe apathy and has no control over passage of her urine. Because of severe apathy, the appellant has no interest in playing or interacting with other children. The appellant would require very close supervision of an attendant for her day-to-day care. The appellant would also require admission in a special school or training by a special education teacher. 16. Dr. Monica Juneja (PW-3) has also stated that, due to all these problems, her marriage prospects may be affected. However, her possibility of procreation is not affected on account of mental retardation. 17. This Court, in the case of Kajal (supra), had an opportunity to consider a case with identical facts. In the said case, a girl (Kajal) aged 12 sustained brain injuries on account of an accident. The accident had very serious consequences on her. Kajal was examined for an assessment of her disability. It was assessed that, because of the head injury, Kajal is left with very low IQ and severe weakness in all her four limbs, she suffers from severe hysteria and severe urinary incontinence. Her disability had been assessed as 100%. 18. This Court, in the said case, referred to a number of cases where the principles for grant of compensation have been enunciated. Cases from foreign jurisdiction as well as cases of this Court were relied upon to extract the principles to be applied while assessing compensation. It would be apposite to refer to the following paragraphs of the said case: “8. In Phillips v. London & South Western Railway Co. [Phillips v. London & South Western Railway Co., (1879) [L.R.] 5 Q.B.D. 78 (CA)] , Field, J., while emphasising that damages must be full and adequate, held thus : (QBD p. 79) “… You cannot put the plaintiff back again into his original position, but you must bring your reasonable common sense to bear, and you must always recollect that this is the only occasion on which compensation can be given. The plaintiff can never sue again for it. You have, therefore, now to give him compensation once and for all. He has done no wrong, he has suffered a wrong at the hands of the defendants and you must take care to give him full fair compensation for that which he has suffered.” Besides, the Tribunals should always remember that the measures of damages in all these cases “should be such as to enable even a tortfeasor to say that he had amply atoned for his misadventure”. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49053501/ 5 Baby Sakshi Greola vs Manzoor Ahmad Simon on 11 December, 2024 9. In Mediana, In re [Mediana, In re, 1900 AC 113 (HL)] , Lord Halsbury held : (AC pp. 116-17) “… Of course the whole region of inquiry into damages is one of extreme difficulty. You very often cannot even lay down any principle upon which you can give damages; nevertheless, it is remitted to the jury, or those who stand in place of the jury, to consider what compensation in money shall be given for what is a wrongful act. Take the most familiar and ordinary case : how is anybody to measure pain and suffering in moneys counted? Nobody can suggest that you can by any arithmetical calculation establish what is the exact amount of money which would represent such a thing as the pain and suffering which a person has undergone by reason of an accident. In truth, I think it would be very arguable to say that a person would be entitled to no damages for such things. What manly mind cares about pain and suffering that is past? But nevertheless the law recognises that as a topic upon which damages may be given.” 10. The following observations of Lord Morris in his speech in H. West & Son Ltd. v. Shephard [H. West & Son Ltd. v. Shephard, 1964 AC 326 : (1963) 2 WLR 1359 (HL)] , are very pertinent : (AC p. 346) “… Money may be awarded so that something tangible may be procured to replace something else of the like nature which has been destroyed or lost. But money cannot renew a physical frame that has been battered and shattered. All that Judges and courts can do is to award sums which must be regarded as giving reasonable compensation. In the process there must be the endeavour to secure some uniformity in the general method of approach. By common assent awards must be reasonable and must be assessed with moderation. Furthermore, it is eminently desirable that so far as possible comparable injuries should be compensated by comparable awards.” In the same case, Lord Devlin observed (at p. 357) that the proper approach to the problem was to adopt a test as to what contemporary society would deem to be a fair sum, such as would allow the wrongdoer to “hold up his head among his neighbours and say with their approval that he has done the fair thing?”, which should be kept in mind by the court in determining compensation in personal injury cases. 11. Lord Denning while speaking for the Court of Appeal in Ward v. James [Ward v. James, (1966) 1 QB 273 : (1965) 2 WLR 455 : (1965) 1 All ER 563 (CA)] , laid down the following three basic principles to be followed in such like cases : (QB pp. 299-300) “First, assessibility : In cases of grave injury, where the body is wrecked or the brain destroyed, it is very difficult to assess a fair compensation in money, so difficult that the award must basically be a conventional figure, derived from experience or from awards in comparable cases. Secondly, uniformity : There should be some measure of uniformity in awards so that similar decisions are given in similar cases; otherwise there will be great dissatisfaction in the community, and much criticism of the administration of justice. Thirdly, predictability : Parties should be able to predict with some measure of accuracy the sum which is likely to be awarded in a particular case, for by this means cases can be settled peaceably and not brought to court, a thing very much to the public good.” (emphasis in original) 12. The assessment of damages in personal injury cases raises great difficulties. It is not easy to convert the physical and mental loss into monetary terms. There has to be a measure of calculated Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49053501/ 6 Baby Sakshi Greola vs Manzoor Ahmad Simon on 11 December, 2024 guesswork and conjecture. An assessment, as best as can, in the circumstances, should be made. 13.McGregor's Treatise on Damages, 14th Edition, Para 1157, referring to heads of damages in personal injury actions states: “The person physically injured may recover both for his pecuniary losses and his non-pecuniary losses. Of these the pecuniary losses themselves comprise two separate items viz. the loss of earnings and other gains which the plaintiff would have made had he not been injured and the medical and other expenses to which he is put as a result of the injury, and the courts have sub-divided the non-pecuniary losses into three categories viz. pain and suffering, loss of amenities of life and loss of expectation of life.” 14. In Concord of India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Nirmala Devi [Concord of India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Nirmala Devi, (1979) 4 SCC 365 : 1979 SCC (Cri) 996 : 1980 ACJ 55] , this Court held : (SCC p. 366, para 2) “2. … the determination of the quantum must be liberal, not niggardly since the law values life and limb in a free country in generous scales.” 15. In R.D. Hattangadi v. Pest Control (India) (P) Ltd. [R.D. Hattangadi v. Pest Control (India) (P) Ltd., (1995) 1 SCC 551 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 250] , dealing with the different heads of compensation in injury cases this Court held thus : (SCC p. 556, para 9) “9. Broadly speaking while fixing the amount of compensation payable to a victim of an accident, the damages have to be assessed separately as pecuniary damages and special damages. Pecuniary damages are those which the victim has actually incurred and which are capable of being calculated in terms of money; whereas non-pecuniary damages are those which are incapable of being assessed by arithmetical calculations. In order to appreciate two concepts pecuniary damages may include expenses incurred by the claimant : (i) medical attendance; (ii) loss of earning of profit up to the date of trial; (iii) other material loss. So far as non-pecuniary damages are concerned, they may include : (i) damages for mental and physical shock, pain and suffering, already suffered or likely to be suffered in the future; (ii) damages to compensate for the loss of amenities of life which may include a variety of matters i.e. on account of injury the claimant may not be able to walk, run or sit; (iii) damages for loss of expectation of life i.e. on account of injury the normal longevity of the person concerned is shortened; (iv) inconvenience, hardship, discomfort, disappointment, frustration and mental stress in life.” 16. In Raj Kumar v. Ajay Kumar [Raj Kumar v. Ajay Kumar, (2011) 1 SCC 343 : (2011) 1 SCC (Civ) 164 : (2011) 1 SCC (Cri) 1161] , this Court laid down the heads under which compensation is to be awarded for personal injuries : (SCC p. 348, para 6) “6. The heads under which compensation is awarded in personal injury cases are the following: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49053501/ 7 Baby Sakshi Greola vs Manzoor Ahmad Simon on 11 December, 2024 (i) Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalisation, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure. (ii) Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earnings on account of permanent disability. (iii) Future medical expenses. Non-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv) Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. (v) Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). (vi) Loss of expectation of life (shortening of normal longevity). In routine personal injury cases, compensation will be awarded only under heads (i), (ii)(a) and (iv). It is only in serious cases of injury, where there is specific medical evidence corroborating the evidence of the claimant, that compensation will be granted under any of the heads (ii)(b), (iii), (v) and (vi) relating to loss of future earnings on account of permanent disability, future medical expenses, loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage) and loss of expectation of life.” 17. In K. Suresh v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. [K. Suresh v. New India Assurance Co. Ltd., (2012) 12 SCC 274 : (2013) 2 SCC (Civ) 279 : (2013) 4 SCC (Cri) 638] , this Court held as follows : (SCC p. 276, para 2) “2. … There cannot be actual compensation for anguish of the heart or for mental tribulations. The quintessentiality lies in the pragmatic computation of the loss sustained which has to be in the realm of realistic approximation. Therefore, Section 168 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (for brevity “the Act”) stipulates that there should be grant of “just compensation”. Thus, it becomes a challenge for a court of law to determine “just compensation” which is neither a bonanza nor a windfall, and simultaneously, should not be a pittance.”” 19. This Court, in the said case, thereafter, formulated various heads such as loss of earnings, expenses related to treatment, attendant charges, pain and suffering and loss of amenities, loss of marriage prospects, future medical treatment. Ultimately, this Court enhanced the compensation awarded by the High Court from Rs. 25,78,501/- to Rs.62,27,000/-. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49053501/ 8 Baby Sakshi Greola vs Manzoor Ahmad Simon on 11 December, 2024 20. In another case titled Master Ayush (supra), this Court was called upon to adjudicate on an appeal filed by a 5-year-old victim of a road accident seeking enhancement of compensation awarded by the Tribunal. 21. In the said case, Ayush was left as a paraplegic patient as a result of the accident. He was examined by two doctors. He was not able to move both his legs and had complete sensory loss in the legs, urinary incontinence, bowel constipation and bed sore. Ayush was aged about 5 years on the date of the accident, hence, he lost his childhood and became dependant on other(s) for his routine work. 22. This Court, in the said case, relying on the decision of Kajal (supra) enhanced the compensation under the head of loss of future earnings due to permanent disability for life, medical expenses, future medical expenses, pain and suffering and loss of amenities, loss of marriage prospects, attendant charges and conveyance charges. This Court enhanced the compensation awarded to the appellant therein from Rs.13,46,805/- to Rs.49,93,000/-. 23. Recently, this Court in the case of K.S. Muralidhar (supra) on an elaborate consideration of certain authorities (scholarly as also judicial) on the aspect of “pain and suffering” set out the contours. It would be relevant to refer to the following paragraphs of the said case: “14. In respect of ‘pain and suffering’ in cases where disability suffered is at 100%, we may notice a few decisions of this Court:— 14.1 In R.D Hattangadi v. Pest Control (India) (P) Ltd. It was observed: “17. The claim under Sl. No. 16 for ‘pain and suffering’ and for loss of amenities of life under Sl. No. 17, are claims for non- pecuniary loss. The appellant has claimed lump sum amount of Rs. 3,00,000 each under the two heads. The High Court has allowed Rs. 1,00,000 against the claims of Rs. 6,00,000. When compensation is to be awarded for ‘pain and suffering’ and loss of amenity of life, the special circumstances of the claimant have to be taken into account including his age, the unusual deprivation he has suffered, the effect thereof on his future life. The amount of compensation for non- pecuniary loss is not easy to determine but the award must reflect that different circumstances have been taken into consideration. According to us, as the appellant was an advocate having good practice in different courts and as because of the accident he has been crippled and can move only on wheelchair, the High Court should have allowed an amount of Rs. 1,50,000 in respect of claim for ‘pain and suffering’ and Rs. 1,50,000 in respect of loss of amenities of life. We direct payment of Rs. 3,00,000 (Rupees three lakhs only) against the claim of Rs. 6,00,000 under the heads “‘pain and suffering’” and “Loss of amenities of life”. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49053501/ 9 Baby Sakshi Greola vs Manzoor Ahmad Simon on 11 December, 2024 (Emphasis Supplied) 14.2 This Judgment was recently referred to by this Court in Sidram v. United India Insurance Company Ltd. reference was also made to Karnataka SRTC v. Mahadeva Shetty (irrespective of the percentage of disability incurred, the observations are instructive), wherein it was observed: “18. A person not only suffers injuries on account of accident but also suffers in mind and body on account of the accident through out his life and a feeling is developed that his no more a normal man and cannot enjoy the amenities of life as another normal person can. While fixing compensation for pain and suffering as also for loss of amenities, features like his age, marital status and unusual deprivation he has undertaken in his life have to be reckoned.” 14.3 In Kajal v. Jagdish Chand considering the facts of the case, i.e., 100% disability, child being bedridden for life, her mental age being that of a nine- month-old for life - a vegetative existence, held that “even after taking a conservative view of the matter an amount payable for the ‘pain and suffering’ of this child should be at least Rs. 15,00,000/-.” 14.4 In Ayush v. Reliance General Insurance relying on Kajal (supra) the amount awarded in ‘pain and suffering’ was enhanced to Rs. 10,00,000. The child who had suffered the accident was five years old and the Court noted in paragraph 2 that: “As per the discharge certificate, the appellant is not able to move both his legs and had complete sensory loss in the legs, urinary incontinence, bowel constipation and bed sores. The appellant was aged about 5 years as on the date of the accident, hence has lost his childhood and is dependent on others for his routine work.” 14.5 In Lalan (supra) cited by the claimant- appellant, the Tribunal awarded Rs. 30,000/- which was enhanced to Rs. 40,000/- by the High Court. Considering the fact that the appellant therein has suffered extensive brain injury awarded compensation under ‘pain and suffering’ to the tune of Rs. 3,00,000/-.” 24. Ultimately, this Court in the said case, in light of the authorities cited, the injuries suffered, the pain and suffering caused, and the lifelong nature of the disability afflicted upon the appellant therein (a workman who sustained multiple brain injuries which resulted in 90% permanent disability) enhanced the compensation awarded under the head of pain and suffering to Rs. 15,00,000/-. 25. In the present case, therefore, we will have to consider the case of the appellant under various heads. a) Loss of income/earning capacity 26. In this respect, it will be appropriate to refer to the evidence of Dr. Monica Juneja (PW-3). The Doctor proved the disability certificate. As per the said certificate, the appellant has suffered 75% disability. The appellant is suffering from moderate mental retardation. It was stated by the Doctor Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49053501/ 10 Baby Sakshi Greola vs Manzoor Ahmad Simon on 11 December, 2024 that the appellant would only be able to learn skills up-to the level of a child of 2nd Standard/Class. The appellant also has severe apathy and no control over passage of her urine. 27. Even though Dr. Monica Juneja (PW-3) on assessment of the appellant opined that the disability suffered by the appellant is 75%, however, on a complete overview of the situation, it is clear that for all practical purposes, the disability of the appellant should be treated to be 100%. 28. The learned Tribunal on appreciation of the medical evidence came to a conclusion that, since the appellant was only seven years at the time of the accident, it would be appropriate to take notional income as per the MV Act to be Rs. 15,000/- per annum. The learned Tribunal applied a multiplier of 15 which was taken up-to the age of fifteen years. Therefore, an amount of 15,000/- x 15 x 75/100 = Rs. 1,68,750/- was awarded by the learned Tribunal. The High Court did not enhance the amount awarded under this head. 29. This Court in the case of Kajal (supra) has held that taking notional income is not the correct approach. Instead, the minimum wages payable to a skilled workman in the concerned State has to be taken into consideration because, that would be the minimum amount which she would have earned on becoming a major. In this case, the minimum wage payable to a skilled workman in the State of Delhi at the time of the accident, i.e., 2nd June 2009, was Rs. 4,358/- per month. 30. Further, a Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of National Insurance Company Limited v. Pranay Sethi and Others4 in paragraph 59 recorded its conclusion as follows: “59. In view of the aforesaid analysis, we proceed to record our conclusions: 59.1. The two-Judge Bench in Santosh Devi [Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Co. Ltd., (2012) 6 SCC 421 : (2012) 3 SCC (Civ) 726 : (2012) 3 SCC (Cri) 160 : (2012) 2 SCC (L&S) 167] should have been well advised to refer the matter to a larger Bench as it was taking a different view than what has been stated in Sarla Verma [Sarla Verma v. DTC, (2009) 6 SCC 121 : (2009) 2 SCC (Civ) 770 : (2009) 2 SCC (Cri) 1002] , a judgment by a coordinate Bench. It is because a coordinate Bench of the same strength cannot take a contrary view than what has been held by another coordinate Bench. 59.2. As Rajesh [Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh, (2013) 9 SCC 54 : (2013) 4 SCC (Civ) 179 : (2013) 3 SCC (Cri) 817 : (2014) 1 SCC (L&S) 149] has not taken note of the decision in Reshma Kumari [Reshma Kumari v. Madan Mohan, (2013) 9 SCC 65 : (2013) 4 SCC (Civ) 191 : (2013) 3 SCC (Cri) 826] , which was delivered at earlier point of time, the decision in Rajesh [Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh, (2013) 9 SCC 54 : (2013) 4 SCC (Civ) 179 : (2013) 3 SCC (Cri) 817 : (2014) 1 SCC (L&S) 149] is not a binding precedent. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49053501/ 11 Baby Sakshi Greola vs Manzoor Ahmad Simon on 11 December, 2024 59.3. While determining the income, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the income of the deceased towards future prospects, where the deceased had a permanent job and was below the age of 40 years, should be made. The addition should be 30%, if the age of the deceased was between 40 to 50 years. In case the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 4 (2017) 16 SCC 680 : 2017 INSC 1068 years, the addition should be 15%. Actual salary should be read as actual salary less tax. 59.4. In case the deceased was self-employed or on a fixed salary, an addition of 40% of the established income should be the warrant where the deceased was below the age of 40 years. An addition of 25% where the deceased was between the age of 40 to 50 years and 10% where the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 years should be regarded as the necessary method of computation. The established income means the income minus the tax component. 59.5. For determination of the multiplicand, the deduction for personal and living expenses, the tribunals and the courts shall be guided by paras 30 to 32 of Sarla Verma [Sarla Verma v. DTC, (2009) 6 SCC 121 : (2009) 2 SCC (Civ) 770 : (2009) 2 SCC (Cri) 1002] which we have reproduced hereinbefore. 59.6. The selection of multiplier shall be as indicated in the Table in Sarla Verma [Sarla Verma v. DTC, (2009) 6 SCC 121 : (2009) 2 SCC (Civ) 770 : (2009) 2 SCC (Cri) 1002] read with para 42 of that judgment. 59.7. The age of the deceased should be the basis for applying the multiplier. 59.8. Reasonable figures on conventional heads, namely, loss of estate, loss of consortium and funeral expenses should be Rs 15,000, Rs 40,000 and Rs 15,000 respectively. The aforesaid amounts should be enhanced at the rate of 10% in every three years.” (emphasis supplied) 31. Accordingly, to arrive at the compensation to be awarded under the head of loss of income and earnings due to disability, 40% should be added for future prospects and a multiplier of 18 would have to be applied in view of the age of the appellant. 32. The same approach was adopted by this Court in the cases of Kajal (supra) and Master Ayush (supra). 33. Therefore, in the present case, the compensation under this head would be Rs. [4,358 + (40% of 4,358)] x 12 x 18 = Rs.13,17,859/- and rounded it off to Rs. 13,18,000/-. b) Pain and Suffering 34. As has been referred to hereinabove, this Court recently in the case of K.S. Muralidhar (supra) relying inter-alia upon the previous decisions of this Court in the cases of Kajal (supra) and Master Ayush (supra) awarded a sum of Rs. 15,00,000/- under the head of pain and suffering to the appellant therein. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49053501/ 12 Baby Sakshi Greola vs Manzoor Ahmad Simon on 11 December, 2024 35. In this respect, it would be appropriate to refer to paragraphs 26 and 27 of the judgment of this Court in the case of Kajal (supra), which read thus: “Pain, suffering and loss of amenities 26. Coming to the non-pecuniary damages under the head of pain, suffering, loss of amenities, the High Court has awarded this girl only Rs 3,00,000. In Mallikarjun v. National Insurance Co. Ltd. [Mallikarjun v. National Insurance Co. Ltd., (2014) 14 SCC 396 : (2015) 1 SCC (Civ) 335 : (2015) 1 SCC (Cri) 372 : (2013) 10 Scale 668] , this Court while dealing with the issue of award under this head held that it should be at least Rs 6,00,000, if the disability is more than 90%. As far as the present case is concerned, in addition to the 100% physical disability, the young girl is suffering from severe incontinence, she is suffering from severe hysteria and above all she is left with a brain of a nine-month- old child. This is a case where departure has to be made from the normal rule and the pain and suffering suffered by this child is such that no amount of compensation can compensate. 27. One factor which must be kept in mind while assessing the compensation in a case like the present one is that the claim can be awarded only once. The claimant cannot come back to court for enhancement of award at a later stage praying that something extra has been spent. Therefore, the courts or the Tribunals assessing the compensation in a case of 100% disability, especially where there is mental disability also, should take a liberal view of the matter when awarding the compensation. While awarding this amount, we are not only taking the physical disability but also the mental disability and various other factors. This child will remain bedridden for life. Her mental age will be that of a nine-month-old child. Effectively, while her body grows, she will remain a small baby. We are dealing with a girl who will physically become a woman but will mentally remain a 9-month-old child. This girl will miss out playing with her friends. She cannot communicate; she cannot enjoy the pleasures of life; she cannot even be amused by watching cartoons or films; she will miss out the fun of childhood, the excitement of youth; the pleasures of a marital life; she cannot have children who she can love, let alone grandchildren. She will have no pleasure. Her's is a vegetable existence. Therefore, we feel in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case even after taking a very conservative view of the matter an amount payable for the pain and suffering of this child should be at least Rs 15,00,000.” (emphasis supplied) 36. This Court has observed that it has to be borne in mind that while assessing compensation in a case like the present one, the claim can be awarded only once. It was observed that the claimant cannot come back to the court for enhancement at a later stage praying that something extra has been spent. This Court further observed that courts or tribunals assessing compensation in a case of 100% disability, especially where there is mental disability also, should take a liberal view of the mater when awarding compensation. It was observed that while awarding this amount, courts are not only taking into account physical disability but also mental disability and various other factors. 37. Similarly, in the case of Master Ayush (supra), this Court in paragraph 14 observed as under: Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49053501/ 13 Baby Sakshi Greola vs Manzoor Ahmad Simon on 11 December, 2024 “14. The determination of damages in personal injury cases is not easy. The mental and physical loss cannot be computed in terms of money but there is no other way to compensate the victim except by payment of just compensation. Therefore, we find that in view of the physical condition, the appellant is entitled to one attendant for the rest of his life though he may be able to walk with the help of assistant device. The device also requires to be replaced every 5 years. Therefore, it is reasonable to award cost of 2 devices i.e. Rs 10 lakhs. The appellant has not only lost his childhood but also adult life. Therefore, loss of marriage prospects would also be required to be awarded. The learned Tribunal has rejected the claim of taxi expenses for the reason that the taxi driver has not been produced. It is impossible to produce the numerous taxi drivers. Still further, the Tribunal should have realised the condition of the child who had complete sensory loss in the legs. Therefore, if the parents of the child have taken him in a taxi, probably that was the only option available to them. Accordingly, we award a sum of Rs 2 lakhs as conveyance charges.” (emphasis supplied) 38. In the present case also, the appellant will remain dependant on another person for the rest of her life. Even though the physical age will increase, but her mental age will be that of a child studying in the 2nd Standard/Class. Effectively, while her body grows, she will remain a small baby. 39. Similar to the case of Kajal (supra), the appellant in the present case will also miss out on partaking in activities which she would have normally done, if she had not met with this unfortunate accident. 40. The High Court, vide impugned judgment and order, only enhanced the compensation under the head of pain and suffering from Rs. 50,000/- as awarded by the learned Tribunal to Rs.1,00,000/-. The same is not commensurate to the impact the unfortunate accident had and will have on the appellant as well as her family members for the rest of their lives. In our view, the compensation should be enhanced further. Therefore, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, we are of the considered view that it would be appropriate to award compensation to the tune of Rs. 15,00,000/- to the present appellant under the head of pain and suffering. c) Loss of marriage prospects 41. In this respect, we reiterate the evidence given by the Dr. Monica Juneja (PW-3) vide the disability certificate wherein she has opined that the mental status of the appellant would be the same as that of a child studying in the 2nd Standard/Class. Further, it was stated that the appellant would also have severe apathy and therefore, maintaining/forming marital/familial bonds with the aforementioned conditions for the appellant is very difficult. 42. The appellant, therefore, has not only lost her childhood but also her adult life. Marriage/companionship is an integral part of the natural life of a human being. Although, in the present case the appellant is capable of reproduction, it is near impossible for her to rear children and enjoy the simple pleasures of marital life and companionship. However, the learned Tribunal in the present case did not award any compensation to the appellant under this head and the High Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49053501/ 14 Baby Sakshi Greola vs Manzoor Ahmad Simon on 11 December, 2024 Court, in appeal, without appreciating the impact of the non- pecuniary loss suffered by the appellant only awarded compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/- for the loss of marriage prospects. 43. We are, therefore, of the opinion that this a fit case where the compensation awarded under the head of loss marriage prospects by the High Court is inadequate and the same must be enhanced to Rs. 5,00,000/-. d) Attendant Charges 44. In the present case, the learned Tribunal recorded the evidence of the appellant’s mother (PW-2). She stated that they had engaged a maid servant to do the household work whom they were paying Rs. 2,500/- per month for a period of 6 months. Considering the same, the learned Tribunal awarded Rs. 2,500 x 6 = Rs. 15,000/- under the head of attendant charges. 45. In appeal, the High Court, in paragraph 3 of the impugned judgment and order, observed that owing to the condition to which the appellant has been reduced, she would require the services of an attendant, though part-time. Accordingly, the High Court adopted the minimum wages of an unskilled worker in the State of Delhi at the time of the accident being Rs. 3,934/-, for a part time attendant, and applied the multiplier of 18. Considering the same, the High Court computed attendant charges to be awarded as Rs. (3,934/- ÷ 2) x 12 x 18 = Rs. 4,24,872/- and rounded it off to Rs. 4,25,000/-. 46. We find that, the approach of the High Court on appreciation of the evidence that the appellant would only be requiring a part time attendant is erroneous. On the contrary, we are of the opinion that the appellant, would be dependent on an attendant throughout her life and on a full-time basis. Considering her medical situation, the attendant would have to be skilled and not unskilled. The appellant would be requiring special care and attention which can only be provided by a skilled attendant. It was, therefore, incorrect on the part of the High Court to proceed on the basis that the appellant could be taken care of by an unskilled attendant and that too on a part-time basis. 47. In this respect, it will be relevant to refer to paragraphs 22, 23 and 24 of Kajal (supra), which read thus: “Attendant charges 22. The attendant charges have been awarded by the High Court @ Rs 2500 per month for 44 years, which works out to Rs 13,20,000. Unfortunately, this system is not a proper system. Multiplier system is used to balance out various factors. When compensation is awarded in lump sum, various factors are taken into consideration. When compensation is paid in lump sum, this Court has always followed the multiplier system. The multiplier system should be followed not only for determining the compensation on account of loss of income but also for determining the attendant charges, etc. This system was recognised by this Court in Gobald Motor Service Ltd. v. R.M.K. Veluswami [Gobald Motor Service Ltd. v. R.M.K. Veluswami, AIR 1962 SC Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49053501/ 15 Baby Sakshi Greola vs Manzoor Ahmad Simon on 11 December, 2024 1] . The multiplier system factors in the inflation rate, the rate of interest payable on the lump sum award, the longevity of the claimant, and also other issues such as the uncertainties of life. Out of all the various alternative methods, the multiplier method has been recognised as the most realistic and reasonable method. It ensures better justice between the parties and thus results in award of “just compensation” within the meaning of the Act. 23. It would be apposite at this stage to refer to the observation of Lord Reid in Taylor v. O'Connor [Taylor v. O'Connor, 1971 AC 115 : (1970) 2 WLR 472 (HL)] : (AC p. 128) “Damages to make good the loss of dependency over a period of years must be awarded as a lump sum and that sum is generally calculated by applying a multiplier to the amount of one year's dependency. That is a perfectly good method in the ordinary case but it conceals the fact that there are two quite separate matters involved — the present value of the series of future payments, and the discounting of that present value to allow for the fact that for one reason or another the person receiving the damages might never have enjoyed the whole of the benefit of the dependency. It is quite unnecessary in the ordinary case to deal with these matters separately. Judges and counsel have a wealth of experience which is an adequate guide to the selection of the multiplier and any expert evidence is rightly discouraged. But in a case where the facts are special I think that these matters must have separate consideration if even rough justice is to be done and expert evidence may be valuable or even almost essential. The special factor in the present case is the incidence of income tax and, it may be, surtax.” 24. This Court has reaffirmed the multiplier method in various cases like MCD v. Subhagwanti [MCD v. Subhagwanti, AIR 1966 SC 1750 : 1966 ACJ 57] , U.P. SRTC v. Trilok Chandra [U.P. SRTC v. Trilok Chandra, (1996) 4 SCC 362] , Sandeep Khanuja v. Atul Dande [Sandeep Khanuja v. Atul Dande, (2017) 3 SCC 351 : (2017) 2 SCC (Civ) 276 : (2017) 2 SCC (Cri) 178] . This Court has also recognised that Schedule II of the Act can be used as a guide for the multiplier to be applied in each case. Keeping the claimant's age in mind, the multiplier in this case should be 18 as opposed to 44 taken by the High Court.” [emphasis supplied] 48. Consistent with the approach adopted by this Court in the cases of Kajal (supra) and Master Ayush (supra), we deem it appropriate to enhance the compensation to be awarded under this head. The minimum wages paid to a skilled worker on a full- time basis in the State of Delhi at the time of the accident was Rs. 4,358/-. Keeping the appellant’s age in mind, the multiplier in the present case should be 18. Accordingly, the compensation to be awarded to the appellant under this head shall be enhanced to Rs. 4,358 x 12 x 18 = Rs. 9,41,328/- and rounded it off to Rs.9,42,000/-. e) Future Medical Treatment 49. As has been referred to hereinabove, the appellant would have to be under the supervision of a full-time skilled attendant. Further, Dr. Monica Juneja (PW-3) has opined that the appellant suffers from severe apathy and has no control over the passage of her urine. Therefore, it is not difficult to Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49053501/ 16 Baby Sakshi Greola vs Manzoor Ahmad Simon on 11 December, 2024 see that the appellant would be requiring medical assistance in the form of medicines, diapers, etc., so as to live a relatively comfortable life. 50. It was also opined by Dr. Monica Juneja (PW-3) that in all cases of mental retardation there is an increased risk of developing convulsions. The Doctor, however, in her testimony before the learned Tribunal had stated that at that time, the appellant was not suffering from the same yet. The possibility of the same, however, cannot be ruled out. 51. Faced with such a situation, the family of the appellant must be financially equipped to deal with the medical conditions, current and potential. It would, therefore, be appropriate to enhance the compensation to be awarded under this head to Rs.5,00,000/-. 52. For ease of understanding and compliance, the revised compensation awarded to the appellant is as follows: S. No. Head Amount (In (cid:131)) 1. Medicines and Medical Treatment 32,000/- 2. Loss of Earning Capacity due to 13,18,000/- Disability 3. Pain and Suffering 15,00,000/- 4. Future Treatment 5,00,000/- 5. Attendant Charges 9,42,000/- 6. Loss of Amenities of Life 1,00,000/- 7. Loss of Future Prospect 1,00,000/- 8. Special Education Expenditure 75,000/- 9. Conveyance and Special Diet 20,000/- 10. Loss of Marriage Prospects 5,00,000/- Total 50,87,000/- 53. The High Court, vide impugned judgment and order, has enhanced the rate of interest awarded by the trial court to 9% per annum from the date of the filing of the claim petition till the actual realisation. We do not find any error with the same and maintain the rate of interest. 54. We direct the Insurance Company (Respondent No. 2) to disburse the compensation awarded to the appellant as above. Obviously, the Insurance Company shall be entitled to adjust the amount already paid, if any. 55. Needless to state, as the learned Tribunal has held the driver-cum-owner (Respondent No.1) and the insurance company (Respondent No. 2) to be jointly and severally liable to make the payment of compensation to the appellant, the inter-se liability of the two respondents herein shall be decided in accordance with law. However, the Insurance Company is directed to make good the compensation awarded to the appellant as per this order so that the appellant and her family members are not put to any further agony. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/49053501/ 17 Baby Sakshi Greola vs Manzoor Ahmad Simon on 11 December, 2024 56. Lastly, we find it appropriate to refer to the order of this Court in the case of General Manager, Kerala State Road Transport Corporation, Trivandrum v. Susamma Thomas (Mrs.) and Others5, wherein it has been reiterated that the claims tribunal should, in the case of minors, invariably order 5 (1994) 2 SCC 176 the amount of compensation awarded to the minor be invested in long term Fixed Deposits at least till the date of the minor attaining majority. However, the expenses incurred by guardian or next friend may be allowed to be withdrawn. 57. We are cognizant of the fact that the appellant has attained majority, however, since the appellant was a minor at the time of the accident, we direct that at present an amount of Rs.10,00,000/- should be disbursed to the father of the appellant as her guardian. If, however, an amount more than Rs. 10,00,000/- has already been disbursed, the said amount shall not be adjusted. We further direct that the rest of the amount be invested in one or more Fixed Deposits Receipts so as to attract the maximum rate of interest. The interest amount shall be payable to the guardian of the appellant every month. Further, it shall be open to the guardian to seek orders from the Tribunal for withdrawal of the amount on the basis of medical opinion, if any major medical expenses are required to be incurred. 58. In the result, the impugned judgment and order dated 7th November 2017 passed by the High Court of Delhi at New Delhi in MAC. APP. 1107/2011 is quashed and set aside. The appeal stands allowed in the above terms. Needless to state, that the Insurance Company (Respondent No. 2) shall comply with this order within a period of eight weeks from today. 59. We place on record our appreciation for the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the parties for their valuable assistance. 60. Pending application(s), if any, are disposed of. ..............................J. (B.R. GAVAI) ................................J. (K.V. VISWANATHAN) NEW DELHI; DECEMBER 11, 2024.

Appellant Versus State of Uttaranchal ...Respondent JUDGMENT J.M. PANCHAL, J. 1. The appellant and one Mumtaz were prosecuted for commission of rape and murder of Yasmeen aged five years daughter of Nayeem Ahmad and for causing disappearance of evidence of those offences. The learned Additional District and Sessions Judge, First FTC Court, Nainital, by judgment dated January 7, 2004, rendered in Sessions Trial No.252 of 1998, convicted the appellant and Mumtaz under Sections 302, 376 and 201 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and imposed penalty of death sentence for commission of offence punishable under Section 302 IPC as well as R.I. for life Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/867974/ 1 Aftab Ahmad Anasari vs State Of Uttaranchal on 12 January, 2010 for commission of offence punishable under Section 376 IPC and a fine of Rs.10,000/- in default R.I. for one year and R.I. for seven years and a fine of Rs.5,000/- in default R.I. for one year for commission of offence punishable under Section 201 IPC. 2. Feeling aggrieved, the appellant and Mumtaz preferred Criminal Appeal No. 36 of 2004 whereas Reference made under Section 366 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the learned Additional Sessions Judge in view of death sentence passed against both the accused was registered as Criminal Reference 1 of 2004 before the High Court of Uttaranchal at Nainital. The Division Bench of the High Court, by judgment dated December 17, 2004, has rejected the Reference and partly allowed the appeal by acquitting accused Mumtaz but affirmed the conviction of the appellant under Sections 302, 376 and 201 IPC. The death penalty awarded to the appellant for commission of offence punishable under Section 302 IPC is modified and the appellant is sentenced to R.I. for life for commission of the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC. The High Court has further maintained sentence imposed on the appellant under Sections 376 and 201 IPC. The confirmation of the conviction of the appellant under Sections 302, 376 and 201 IPC by the High Court and imposition of different punishments for those offences, has given rise to the instant Appeal by Special Leave. 3. Mr. Nayeem Ahmad is resident at Mundia Pistor Village, Bajpur, District Udham Singh Nagar, Uttaranchal. His daughter Yasmeen aged five years having fair complexion and round face, wearing frock, underwear and sleepers was playing near his house at about 5.00 p.m. in the evening of February 5, 1998. It was noticed that she was missing from the place where she was playing and, therefore, Nayeem Ahmad made frantic search about Yasmeen at the places of all his relatives but she could not be traced. As search made by him did not yield any result, he filed a missing report on February 6, 1998 at Bajpur Police Station mentioning, inter alia, that his daughter had disappeared while playing near his house and, therefore, steps be taken to trace her out. On February 8, 1998, Report (Exhibit Ka.2) was lodged at Bajpur Police Station by Shamim Ahmad who is real brother of Nayeem Ahmad stating, inter alia, that Yasmeen aged about five years daughter of his elder brother Nayeem Ahmad while playing near the house of Nayeem Ahmad had disappeared at about 5.00 p.m. in the evening of February 5, 1998 for which Nayeem Ahmad had lodged a missing report at the Police Station, but at about 6.00 a.m. on February 8, 1998, her dead body was found lying on the public way in front of the house of Haji Khursheed, son of Bashir Ahmad of village Bajpur and, therefore, legal action be taken. On receiving this information, concerned police personnel reached the place where dead body of the deceased was lying. The inquest on the dead body of the deceased was held and necessary arrangements were made for sending the dead body for post mortem examination. The post mortem examination was carried out on February 8, 1998. The examination revealed that the deceased was subjected to rape and thereafter strangulated. On February 9, 1998, the Investigating Officer, on the basis of the information given by the informer, arrested both the accused persons under Sections 302, 376 and 201 IPC. While in custody, the appellant and Mumtaz made disclosure statements to the Investigating Officer pursuant to which the appellant discovered one frock with blood marks, one white cotton underwear with black stripes having blood stains and one bed sheet of light green colour with plenty of blood marks from the house of sister of the appellant. The articles discovered were seized under a panchnama and sent to forensic science laboratory for analysis. The Investigating Officer recorded the statement of those persons who were Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/867974/ 2 Aftab Ahmad Anasari vs State Of Uttaranchal on 12 January, 2010 found to be conversant with the facts of the case. On receipt of report from the analyst and on completion of investigation, the appellant and Mumtaz were charge- sheeted in the Court of learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class for commission of offences punishable under Sections 302, 376 and 201 IPC. The offences punishable under Sections 302 and 376 IPC are exclusively triable by a Court of Sessions. Therefore, the case was committed to the Court of learned Additional District and Sessions Judge, Nainital for trial. The learned Judge framed necessary charges against the appellant and Mumtaz for commission of offences punishable under Section 302, 376 and 201 IPC. The same were read over to them. They pleaded not guilty to the same and claimed to be tried. Therefore, prosecution examined seven witnesses and produced documentary evidence to prove its case against the appellant and Mumtaz. After recording of evidence of prosecution witnesses was over, the learned Judge explained to the appellant and Mumtaz the circumstances appearing against them in the evidence of prosecution witnesses and recorded their further statement as required by Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. In the further statements, the appellant and Mumtaz pleaded ignorance in respect of certain facts whereas in relation to some other facts their claim was that they were false. The appellant and Mumtaz had expressed desire to examine defence witnesses which was granted by the learned Judge. The appellant, therefore, examined DW1, Ms. Bilkis and DW2, Lakhbinder Singh alias Lakha in defence. The learned Judge noticed that the case was entirely resting upon circumstantial evidence. After holding that the deceased died a homicidal death, the learned Judge appreciated the evidence and held that four circumstances, namely, that (1) both the accused were seen by PW-3, Naseed Ahmad, at about 4.30 a.m. on 8.2.1998 fleeing away from near the place where the dead body of deceased Yasmeen was found after some time; (2) on the disclosure statement made by the appellant, blood stained frock and underwear of the deceased and blood stained bed sheet were recovered; (3) underwears of both the accused, seized, were stained with human blood and semen; and (4) extra- judicial confession was made by the appellant before PW-5, Anand Swaroop, are firmly established, to bring home guilt of the accused under Sections 302, 376 and 201 IPC. The learned Judge noticed that the chain of circumstances established was complete, cumulative effect of which was indicating that in all human probability, the offences were committed by the appellant and Mumtaz and by none other. In view of abovementioned conclusions, the learned Judge convicted the appellant and Mumtaz under Section 302, 376 and 201 IPC. Thereafter, the learned Judge heard the appellant and Mumtaz on the question of sentence to be imposed on them for commission of abovementioned offences. The learned Judge noticed that this was the rarest of rare case falling within the purview of guidelines laid down by this Court in Maulai & Anr. Vs. State of M.P. AIR 2000 SC 177 and imposed death penalty on both the accused for commission of offence punishable under Section 302 IPC. The learned Judge further imposed punishment of R.I. for life and a fine of Rs.10,000/- and in default R.I. for one year for commission of offence punishable under Section 376 IPC. The learned Judge further imposed sentence of R.I. for seven years and a fine of Rs.5,000/- and in default R.I. for one year for commission of offence punishable under Section 201 IPC by judgment dated January 7, 2004. The imposition of death sentence resulted into Criminal Reference under Section 366 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The appellant and Mumtaz also being aggrieved by the judgment of the Trial Court preferred Criminal Appeal No.36 of 2004 before the High Court of Uttaranchal at Nainital. The reference and appeal were heard together. The High Court on re-appreciation of evidence came to the conclusion Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/867974/ 3 Aftab Ahmad Anasari vs State Of Uttaranchal on 12 January, 2010 that three circumstances were proved by the prosecution, namely, (1) both the appellants were seen by PW3, Naseem Ahmad at about 4.30 a.m. on February 8, 1998 fleeing from near the place where the dead body of the deceased was found; (2) blood stained frock and underwear of the deceased and blood stained bed sheet were recovered pursuant to voluntary disclosure statement made by the appellant; and (3) extra judicial confession was made by the appellant before PW-5, Anand Swaroop. The Division Bench by judgment dated December 17, 2004 has partly allowed the appeal. The High Court has set aside the conviction of Mumtaz recorded by the Trial Court but confirmed the conviction of the appellant recorded by the Trial Court under Sections 302, 376 and 201 IPC. The High Court has further modified the sentence of death imposed on the appellant for commission of offence punishable under Section 302 IPC and awarded R.I. for life whereas sentences awarded for commission of offences punishable under Sections 376 and 201 have been confirmed. 4. This Court has heard the learned counsel for the parties and considered the documents forming part of the appeal. It is relevant to notice that the prosecution has not claimed that the rape and murder of the deceased was witnessed by anyone and no direct evidence regarding the same is adduced before the court. Admittedly, the whole case against the appellant rests on circumstantial evidence. The law relating to circumstantial evidence is well settled. In dealing with circumstantial evidence, there is always a danger that conjecture or suspicion lingering on mind may take place of proof. Suspicion howsoever strong cannot be allowed to take place of proof and, therefore, the Court has to judge watchfully and ensure that the conjectures and suspicions do not take place of legal proof. However, it is no derogation of evidence to say that it is circumstantial. Human agency may be faulty in expressing picturization of actual incident but the circumstances cannot fail. Therefore, many a times, it is aptly said that ""men may tell lies, but circumstances do not"". In cases where evidence is of a circumstantial nature, the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should, in the first instance, be fully established. Each fact must be proved individually and only thereafter the Court should consider the total cumulative effect of all the proved facts, each one of which reinforces the conclusion of the guilt. If the combined effect of all the facts taken together is conclusive in establishing the guilt of the accused, the conviction would be justified even though it may be that one or more of these facts, by itself/themselves, is/are not decisive. The circumstances proved should be such as to exclude every hypothesis except the one sought to be proved. But this does not mean that before the prosecution case succeeds in a case of circumstantial evidence alone, it must exclude each and every hypothesis suggested by the accused, howsoever extravagant and fanciful it might be. There must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability, the act must have been done by the accused. Where the various links in a chain are in themselves complete, then a false plea or a false defence may be called into aid only to lend assurance to the Court. If the circumstances proved are consistent with the innocence of the accused, then the accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt. However, in applying this principle, distinction must be made between facts called primary or basic on the one hand and inference of facts to be drawn from them on the other. In regard to the proof of basic or primary facts, the Court has to judge the evidence and decide whether that evidence proves a particular fact or not and if that fact is proved, the question arises whether that fact leads to the inference of guilt of the accused person or not. In dealing with this aspect of the problem, the doctrine of benefit of doubt applies. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/867974/ 4 Aftab Ahmad Anasari vs State Of Uttaranchal on 12 January, 2010 Although there should be no missing links in the case, yet it is not essential that every one of the links must appear on the surface of the evidence adduced and some of these links may have to be inferred from the proved facts. In drawing these inferences or presumptions, the Court must have regard to the common course of natural events, and to human conduct and their relations to the facts of the particular case. 5. Having noticed the relevant principles governing a case based on circumstantial evidence, this Court proposes to consider the question whether the case against the appellant is proved. The appellant, at the time of incident was in his early 20's. He is resident of village Patia Nagla, P.S. Gatpur, Tehsil Thakurdwara, District Muradabad. His sister Ms. Bilkis, DW-1, was married to Kabir Ahmad of village Bajpur where the first informant is residing. The appellant used to visit and stay at the house of his sister. It may be mentioned that the Trial Court was of the view that four circumstances mentioned above were proved by the prosecution. 6. The fact that deceased Yasmeen was subjected to rape and died a homicidal death is not disputed before this Court by the appellant. This fact stands amply proved by the reliable testimony of Dr. J.S. Rawat, who performed autopsy on the dead body of the deceased and contents of post mortem produced at Exhibit Ka.5. 7. Similarly the fact that naked dead body of deceased Yasmeen with injuries was found lying at about 6.00 a.m. on 8.2.1998 in front of the house of Haji Khursheed is amply borne out from the trustworthy testimony of PW-1, Nayeem Ahmad, PW-2, Shamim Ahmad, inquest report Exhibit Ka.4 etc. 8. According to the Sessions Court and the High Court, one of the incriminating circumstances proved by the prosecution is that witness Naseem Ahmad had seen the appellant and another fleeing from near the place where the dead body of the deceased was found lying at about 4.30 am on February 8,1998. The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the only witness produced by the prosecution to prove this circumstance is PW-3, Naseem Ahmad but the said witness does not speak of any source of light and his silence of not telling this fact to the Investigating Officer at the time of holding of inquest is most unnatural and, therefore, the High Court had erred in placing reliance on his evidence. Elaborating this argument, it was submitted that the statement of Naseem Ahmad under Section 161 was recorded on February 9, 1998 after the arrest of the appellant and Mumtaz was effected and he does not say that he had seen the accused carrying dead body or dropping any object in front of the house of Haji Khursheed. It was pointed out that he is a close relative of the complainant who asserted that before the report of recovery of dead body was lodged by Shamim, he had told Nayeem and Shamim that he had seen the appellant and Mumtaz running away from near the place where the dead body was found lying but no such fact was stated in the report made by witness Shamim Ahmad and, therefore, his claim that he had seen the appellant fleeing from near the place where the dead body was found lying should have been disbelieved. What was stressed was that according to the said witness, he and Jakir were going to jungle for answering the call of nature and seen the appellant entering into the house of his sister but for the same reason, the appellant could have been out of his sister's house and, therefore, the appellant entering into the house of his sister could not have been treated as an incriminating circumstance. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/867974/ 5 Aftab Ahmad Anasari vs State Of Uttaranchal on 12 January, 2010 What was claimed was that neither this circumstance sought to be relied upon by the prosecution stands proved beyond doubt by witness Naseem Ahmad nor the same can be characterised as an incriminating circumstance and, therefore, the same should be ignored while appreciating the evidence against the appellant. 9. So far as the circumstance, namely, that the appellant and Mumtaz were seen fleeing away from near the place where the dead body of the deceased was lying is concerned, this Court finds that the prosecution has relied upon the testimony of PW2, Naseem Ahmad. After mentioning that younger daughter of his brother Nayeem had disappeared on February 5, 1998, the witness has mentioned that in the morning of February 8, 1998 at about 4.30 a.m. he himself and one Jakir were going towards jungle and when they reached near the house of Haji Khursheed, they had seen the appellant and Mumtaz running from near the house of Haji Khursheed and entering into the house of Kabir. It may be stated that Kabir is brother-in-law of the appellant, i.e., husband of Ms. Bilkis who is sister of the appellant. The witness has claimed in his evidence that he was knowing Aftab, i.e., the appellant and Mumtaz before the incident. According to this witness, when they came back from the jungle at that time, they learnt that on the same day, dead body of daughter of Nayeem Ahmad was found near the house of Haji Khursheed. This witness was subjected to searching cross- examination by the defence. In his cross examination, the witness stated that his house was located after two houses from the house of Haji Khursheed. According to him Jakir who is his brother-in-law had come to his house from village Mudia Kalan. During this cross-examination, the witness also explained that Jakir was real brother-in-law of Nayeem and, thus, deceased was niece of Jakir. What was maintained by the said witness was that both of them had proceeded to jungle at about 4.30 a.m. for answering the call of nature and had seen the appellant and Mumtaz while they were going to jungle. According to this witness, the Investigating Officer had recorded his statement on the next day of recovery of the dead body. It was further stated by this witness in his cross-examination that the deceased was missing since February 5, 1998 whereas her dead body was found on February 8, 1998. The witness has further mentioned that by the time they had come back from the jungle, the dead body had already been found and one missing report was written on February 6, 1998 which was scribed and lodged by Shamim after the dead body was found. It was stated by him that he was not present at the time of writing of the report by Shamim but before the report was written, Shamim and Nayeem were told by him and Jakir that they had seen the appellant and Mumtaz running away from near the place where the dead body was lying. The witness further mentioned in his cross- examination that the report was scribed after arrival of sniffer dog called by the police. It was explained by the witness that sniffer dog had been brought at 7.30 a.m. The suggestion made by the defence that he had not seen anyone running away from near the place where the dead body was lying and was deposing falsely on account of relationship with Nayeem was emphatically denied by him. 10. A fair reading of the evidence tendered by this witness makes it evident that though he is relative of Nayeem, he has stated the facts seen by him in a simple manner and without any noticeable embellishments. If this witness wanted to implicate the appellant falsely in the case because of his relationship with the first informant, nothing prevented him from stating before the police and the court that he had seen the appellant carrying the dead body of the deceased and throwing the same Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/867974/ 6 Aftab Ahmad Anasari vs State Of Uttaranchal on 12 January, 2010 near the house of Haji Khursheed. 11. However, this Court finds that he has not made any false claim/exaggeration in his testimony at all and stated that he had seen the appellant fleeing from near the place where the dead body was lying. The reason as to why in the early morning he was out of his house is stated by him, which this Court finds to be most natural. It could not be even remotely suggested by the defence that a constructed latrine was available in the house of witness Naseem Ahmad and, therefore, it was not necessary for him to move out of his house in the early morning of February 8, 1998 to go to jungle for answering call of nature. What is relevant to notice is that at the time when this witness had seen the appellant running away from near the place where the dead body was found, he had not learnt that the dead body was already found. Further, his house is located after two houses from the house of Haji Khursheed and the house of Ms. Bilkis, who is sister of the appellant and with whom the appellant was residing at the relevant point of time, is quite near to the house of Haji Khursheed. Therefore, the claim made by the witness that he had seen the appellant hurriedly entering the house of his sister sounds probable. No major contradiction and/or omission with regard to his earlier statement recorded before the police nor any other material could be brought on record by the defence to impeach his credibility. Merely because Shamim did not refer to the fact that he was told by Naseem Ahmad that Naseem Ahmad had seen the appellant running away from near the place where the dead body was lying in his report to the police, cannot be a ground to disbelieve this witness. The learned Judge of the Trial Court who had advantage of observing demeanour of this witness has found the witness to be truthful. The assertion made by the witness that the appellant and Mumtaz were known to him could not be disputed by the defence at all. It was claimed by this witness in terms before the Court that he had seen the appellant running away from near the place where the dead body was lying. When it was stated by the appellant that he had seen the appellant running away from near the place where the dead body was lying, it was for the defence to suggest that in the early morning of February 8, 1998, no source of light was available and, therefore, he could not have seen the appellant so running away. However, this Court finds that even remotely it was not suggested to the witness that there was no source of light and, therefore, he could not have seen the appellant running away from near the place where the dead body was lying. The plea that this witness maintained silence at the time when the inquest on the dead body of the deceased was held and did not tell the Investigating Officer that he had seen the appellant running away from near the place where the dead body was lying would indicate that he had not seen the appellant running away, is merely stated to be rejected. The occasion for this witness to tell the Investigating Officer that he had seen the appellant running away from near the place where the dead body was lying would arise only when the Investigating Officer was to record his statement under Section 161. The basic purpose of holding inquest on the dead body is to ascertain prima facie the nature of death and to find out whether there are injuries on the dead body or not. The inquest punchnama cannot be treated as statement of the witness recorded under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure wherein he is supposed to narrate the facts seen by him. Therefore, it is not true to say that he had maintained silence and had not told the Investigating Officer at the time of holding of the inquest that he had seen the appellant running away from near the place where the dead body was lying. The so called silence on the part of this witness cannot be considered to be unnatural at all nor the same makes this testimony doubtful in any manner. It is true that the appellant who was staying in the house of his sister cannot be said to have committed any unnatural conduct by entering into the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/867974/ 7 Aftab Ahmad Anasari vs State Of Uttaranchal on 12 January, 2010 house of his sister. However, it is not the case of witness Naseem Ahmad that he had seen the appellant calmly entering into the house of his sister. What is mentioned by the witness is that he had seen the appellant running away from near the place where the dead body was found and hurriedly entering house of his sister. The `running away' part attributed to the appellant could not be explained by him. In his further statement, it could not be explained by the appellant as to what made him running away from near the place where the dead body was found and hurriedly entering into the house of his sister. On reappraisal of the evidence of this witness, this Court finds that neither the Trial Court nor the High Court committed any error in placing reliance on the testimony of this witness for coming to the conclusion that one of the incriminating circumstances, namely, that the appellant was found fleeing from near the place where the dead body was found lying was satisfactorily proved. 12. Another circumstance sought to be relied upon by the prosecution is that the appellant had made voluntary disclosure statement pursuant to which blood stained clothes of the deceased were discovered. The disclosure statement was made by the appellant in presence of PW4, Rais Ahmad. To prove the recovery of clothes of the deceased, the prosecution has relied upon the testimony of two witnesses, namely, PW4, Rais Ahmad and PW7, Praveen Kumar Tyagi, the Investigating Officer. PW4, Rais Ahmad has stated that on February 8, 1998 Police had come to village Bajpur at about 3.30 p.m. and they had brought with them the appellant and Mumtaz. According to this witness, he and Lakhvinder Singh were standing at the place where the appellant was brought by the police. It is mentioned by the witness that police had called him and Lakhvinder Singh and asked them to accompany them. What is stated by the witness is that the appellant and Mumtaz led them to the house of Kabir and the appellant took out one sleeveless frock, one underwear and one green coloured bed sheet from the foodgrains room of the house of Kabir. The witness further stated that the abovementioned articles were kept hidden under the leaves and after taking out those articles, the appellant had told that these were the clothes of Yasmeen which he had concealed. It was further stated by the witness that seizure memo was prepared by the Investigating Officer on the spot and his signature was obtained thereon after it was read over to him. The witness identified his signature on the memo (Exhibit Ka.3). In his cross-examination, the witness stated that Shamim who is his elder brother was brother-in-law of the complainant. According to this witness, the appellant used to live in the house of his sister. What was mentioned by the witness was that Shabnam, daughter of sister of the appellant, was of the age group of Yasmeen and he was not remembering correctly whether Kabir, i.e., brother-in-law of the appellant was living with his family in the house from which the appellant had taken out the clothes of the deceased. It was mentioned by the witness that the sniffer dog had first smelt the dead body and then the said dog had entered into house of Kabir and picked up the appellant. It was further stated by the witness that the dog did not pick up Mumtaz and after the smelling by sniffer dog, the police had arrested the appellant and Mumtaz in his presence. What is testified by the witness is that many persons had gone up to the police station and he had also gone to the police station where his signatures were obtained on Exhibit Ka.3 at about 4.00 p.m. The suggestion made to the witness by the defence that no clothes were recovered in his presence and that he was deposing falsely was emphatically denied by him. 13. The testimony of Investigating Officer makes it more than clear that after arrest, the appellant had made disclosure statement and willingness to show the place where the clothes of the deceased Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/867974/ 8 Aftab Ahmad Anasari vs State Of Uttaranchal on 12 January, 2010 were concealed by him. This fact is also mentioned in Exhibit Ka.3 which was prepared contemporaneously. According to the Investigating Officer, he had made efforts to summon local witnesses from Akari Pistor but none had agreed to be a witness and, therefore, Rais Ahmad and Lakhvinder Singh were summoned to be panch witnesses on way to the place to be pointed out by the appellant where he had concealed the clothes of the deceased. According to this witness, the appellant and Mumtaz led the police party and the appellant took out clothes of the deceased, i.e., blood stained frock and underwear as well as one bed sheet from Kuria meant for storing foodgrains. The witness further stated that clothes of the deceased and bed sheets were kept in the western corner of the room. The witness also informed the Court that underwears of both the accused were seized and they appeared to be stained with semen at some places. The argument that witness Rais Ahmad has not stated about the disclosure statement at all and, therefore, discovery of the clothes of the deceased should be disbelieved cannot be accepted. As explained by the Investigating Officer, the appellant and Mumtaz had made disclosure statement when they were at the police station. The said fact is mentioned in the document prepared contemporaneously. As explained by the Investigating Officer, he had made efforts to summon two independent witnesses to act as panchas but none had shown willingness to do so and, therefore, he had requisitioned services of Rais Ahmad and another on way to the house of sister of the appellant from where the clothes of the deceased were recovered. The contention that that part of the disclosure statement showing that recovered frock and underwear were of the deceased and the bed sheet was one over which rape was committed cannot be read in evidence has no substance. In the leading case of Pulukuri Kottaya & Ors. Vs. Emperor AIR 1947 PC 67 what would be admissible in a disclosure statement has been explained by the Privy Council giving illustration as under : ""The statements to which exception is taken in this case are first a statement by accused No.6 which he made to the police sub-Inspector and which was reduced into writing, and is Exhibit ""P."" It is in these terms : `The mediatornama written at 9 a.m. on 12.1.1945, in front of Maddineni Verrayya's choultry and in the presence of the undersigned mediators. Statement made by the accused Inala Sydayya on being arrested. About 14 days ago, I Kotayya and people of my party lay in wait for Sivayya and others at about sunset time at the corner of Pulipad tank. We, all beat Beddupati China Sivayya and Subayya, to death. The remaining persons, Pullayya, Kotayya and Narayana ran away. Dondapati Ramayya who was in our party received blows on his hands. He had a spear in his hands. He gave it to me then. I hid it and my stick in the rick of Venkatanarasu in the village. I will show if you come. We did all this at the instigation of Pulukuri Kotayya.' (Signed) Potla China mattayya. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/867974/ 9 Aftab Ahmad Anasari vs State Of Uttaranchal on 12 January, 2010 ( "" ) Kotta Krishnayya. 12th January, 1945. (Sgd.) G. Bapaiah, Sub-Inspector of Police. The whole of that statement except the passage ""I hid it (a spear) and my stick in the rick of Venkatanarasu in the village. I will show if you come"" is inadmissible. In the evidence of the witness Potla China Mattayya proving the document the statement that accused 6 said ""I Mattayya and others went to the corner of the tank-land. We killed Sivayya and Subayya"" must be omitted. A confession of accused 3 was deposed to by the police Sub-Inspector, who said that accused 3 said to him : `I stabbed Sivayya with a spear, I hid the spear in a yard in my village. I will show you the place."" The first sentence must be omitted. This was followed by a Mediatornama, Ex.Q.I, which is unobjectionable except for a sentence in the middle, `He said that it was with that spear that he had stabbed Boddapati Sivayya,' which must be omitted."" Thus, the part of the disclosure statement, namely, that he was ready to show the place where he had concealed the clothes of the deceased is clearly admissible under Section 27 of the Evidence Act because the same relates distinctly to the discovery of the clothes of the deceased from that very place. The contention that even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that the clothes of the deceased were recovered from the house of the sister of the appellant pursuant to the voluntary disclosure statement made by the appellant, the prosecution has failed to prove that the clothes so recovered belonged to the deceased and, therefore, the recovery of the clothes should not be treated as an incriminating circumstances is devoid of merits. First of all, what is relevant to notice is that in the missing report, it was mentioned by Nayeem Ahmad that his daughter aged five years, who was wearing frock and underwear, was missing from near the house while playing.; Thus, the wearing of the frock and underwear was mentioned by the father of the girl at the first available opportunity. The statement by Nayeem, PW1, as well as statement made by Shamim, PW2, that there were no clothes on the dead body of the deceased has gone unchallenged. Naturally, therefore, it was necessary for the Investigating Officer to find out as to where the clothes put on by the deceased were concealed. What is relevant to notice is that Ms. Bilkis who is sister of the appellant and who is examined as DW1 mentioned in her testimony before the Court that the police had taken into custody the clothes belonging to her daughter Shabnam. However, the record of the case shows that the frock and the underwear recovered from the house of Ms. Bilkis pursuant to disclosure statement made by the appellant were blood stained. It was never the case of Ms. Bilkis that the frock and underwear recovered or seized by the police were blood stained and belonged to her daughter Shabnam. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/867974/ 10 Aftab Ahmad Anasari vs State Of Uttaranchal on 12 January, 2010 Further, the clothes were recovered pursuant to the voluntary disclosure statement made by the appellant on February 9, 1998 whereas Ms. Bilkis made claim that the clothes, which belonged to her daughter, were recovered and seized on September 30, 2003 when she was examined by the appellant as one of the defence witnesses. If the police had seized the clothes belonging to her daughter, Ms. Bilkis would not have maintained tacit silence for roughly about more than five years and would have made grievance before higher police officers or court within reasonable time. A bare reading of her testimony makes it more than clear that she had come to depose before the Court to save the appellant who is her real brother and stated wrong facts for the first time before the Court. Her case that the police personnel had given 2 to 4 blows of stick to her and threatened her that she and her husband would be implicated in the case, does not inspire confidence of this Court. Further, Exhibit Ka.3 which is seizure memo of the clothes of the deceased recovered from the house of Ms. Bilkis pursuant to the disclosure statement made by the appellant, mentions that the frock recovered was made of terry-cotton fabric and its upper portion was white whereas lower portion was brown coloured and there were prints of flowers. The panchnama further indicates that it was sleeveless and stained with blood marks. Similarly, underwear discovered was made of cotton. It was white in colour with black stripes having blood stains. Though Bilkis who was examined as DW1 claimed that the clothes recovered from her house belonged to her daughter Shabanam, she could not give description of either frock or the underwear seized during the course of her testimony before the court. On overall view of the matter, this Court finds that it was satisfactorily proved by the prosecution that the frock and underwear, recovered from the house of DW1 Ms. Bilkis pursuant to the voluntary disclosure statement made by the appellant, belonged to the deceased. 14. Yet another circumstance relied upon by the prosecution is that the underwear of the appellant was stained with blood and semen. The fact that underwear put on by the appellant was seized under a panchnama is not disputed on behalf of the appellant at all. The High Court ignored this circumstance stating that the appellant was young and, therefore, find of semen stains was natural. However, the High Court ignored the material fact that in normal course, the underwear would not have blood stains at all and, therefore, it was for the appellant to offer explanation as to under what circumstances stains of blood were found on his underwear, seized by the police during the course of investigation. The fact that the underwear of the appellant seized by the police had human blood stains is sufficiently proved by the contents of report of Chemical Analyst. The fact that the blood stained underwear put on by the appellant was seized after four days does not make any dent in the prosecution case on the ground that a person would not move with such blood stained underwear for 3 - 4 days. One cannot lose sight of the fact that those stains were not visible and even the Investigating Officer had stated that on examination the underwear put on by the appellant appeared to be stained with semen at some places. If blood stains are found on the shirt or pant of a person then normally such person would not move in the village with those clothes on, because stains of blood would be visible and noticed by anyone. However, it is almost difficult for anyone to notice stains of blood on underwear worn by a person. Further, the sense of cleanliness of a rustic villager cannot be ignored by the Court. While recording the statement of the appellant under Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/867974/ 11 Aftab Ahmad Anasari vs State Of Uttaranchal on 12 January, 2010 Section 313 of the Code, it was put to him by the learned Judge that during the course of investigation his blood stained underwear was seized by the Police and his explanation was sought. In answer to the said question, it was never claimed by the appellant that the underwear seized was not blood stained and that another underwear was substituted in place of his underwear which was seized. Thus, this Court finds that the High Court was not justified at all in ignoring the circumstance sought to be relied upon by the prosecution that blood stained underwear of the appellant was recovered during the course of investigation. 15. Another circumstance sought to be relied upon by the prosecution is that the appellant made extra judicial confession before PW5, Anand Swaroop. The evidence of this witness shows that he was one of the panchas when inquest on the dead body of the deceased was held. During the course of his testimony, the witness identified his signature on the inquest report which was produced by the prosecution at Exhibit Ka.4. According to this witness, on February 23, 1998, he had been to Kasipur Court in connection with some work. What is asserted by the witness is that the appellant who is brother-in-law of Kabir had come to Court premises and told him near the shops that he and Mumtaz had killed Yasmeen after committing rape on her. The witness further asserted that the reason for making extra judicial confession by the appellant was that he was ex-pradhan of the village and the appellant was under an impression that the witness would be able to help him by approaching the police. This witness in no uncertain terms asserted before the court that he had told the Investigating Officer about the extra judicial confession made by the appellant. In his cross-examination, the witness stated that police had recorded his statement only once. According to the witness, police had recorded his statement sometime between 23 to 29th February, 1998 in the village. What is mentioned by the witness in his cross-examination is that the appellant had come after February 23, 1998 and, therefore, he had not thought it necessary to tell the police about the extra judicial confession made by the appellant. The suggestion made by the defence that the police used to visit house of this witness daily or that the witness used to go to the police station daily, is denied by the witness. The manner in which this suggestion is made to the witness indicates that the appellant was entertaining a notion that the witness would be in a position to help him because the witness that the witness was going to the Police Station daily and policemen were also visiting him. In the cross- examination also, the witness maintained that the appellant had met him on February 23, 1998 in the court premises and neither the appellant nor Mumtaz was in the lockup nor inside the court room and that the appellant had made the confession near the shops. The witness explained to the court as to why he had gone to the court and according to him he had gone to the court premises to meet one Ashish Sharma, legal adviser of the bank for getting his brother's NOC prepared. The witness further mentioned before the Court that the appellant and Mumtaz had met him between 11.30 and 12 noon. The suggestion made by the defence that it was wrong to say that the appellant had made any confessional statement was emphatically denied by him. It may be mentioned that this witness in the cross- examination had stated that the appellant was not on talking or visiting terms with him before February 23, 1998 and, therefore, it was argued that there was no reason for the appellant to confide in this witness. However, what is relevant to notice is that the witness was ex-pradhan of Bajpur village. Ex-Pradhan certainly enjoys a status in a small village. The case of the defence was that the appellant was knowing that the witness was close to the police and was going to the Police Station daily. Under the circumstances, thinking that the witness would Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/867974/ 12 Aftab Ahmad Anasari vs State Of Uttaranchal on 12 January, 2010 be able to render some help to him, the appellant had made extra judicial confession. The Court, on re-appreciation of evidence, finds that it is not brought on the record of the case that this witness was on inimical terms with the appellant. In fact, this witness does not belong to the community of the appellant and belongs to another community. There was no earthly reason for this witness to come to the court and depose falsely about the extra judicial confession made by the appellant. Though extra judicial confession is considered to be a weak piece of evidence by the courts, this Court finds that there is neither any rule of law nor of prudence that the evidence furnishing extra judicial confession cannot be relied upon unless corroborated by some other credible evidence. The evidence relating to extra judicial confession can be acted upon if the evidence about extra judicial confession comes from the mouth of a witness who appears to be unbiased and in respect of whom even remotely nothing is brought out which may tend to indicate that he may have a motive for attributing an untruthful statement to the accused. In State of U.P. vs. M.K. Anthony AIR 1985 SC 48, this Court, while explaining the law relating to extra judicial confession, ruled that if the word spoken by the witness are clear, unambiguous and unmistakable one showing that the accused is the perpetrator of the crime and nothing is omitted by the witness which may militate against it, then after subjecting the evidence of the witness to a rigorous test on the touchstone of credibility, the extra judicial confession can be accepted and can be the basis of a conviction. According to this Court, in such a situation, to go in search of corroboration itself tends to cause a shadow of doubt over the evidence and if the evidence of extra judicial confession is reliable, trustworthy and beyond reproaching, the same can be relied upon and a conviction can be founded thereon. Here, in this case, it is proved by the prosecution that PW5, Anand Swaroop was not on inimical terms with the appellant at all. After subjecting his evidence to a rigorous test on the touchstone of credibility, this Court finds that extra judicial confession referred to by the witness is reliable and is rightly accepted by the Trial Court and the High Court. The contention that when the appellant was being brought to the court, he was in custody and, therefore, the extra judicial confession referred to by PW5 would be hit by the provisions of Section 26 of the Evidence Act and could not have been received in evidence, cannot be accepted. As observed earlier, the record shows that the appellant and another were produced before the Court for extension of judicial remand. The appellant could not probablise his defence that he was in custody of police officer. He could not name the police officer who had brought him with Mumtaz to the Court premises for extension of judicial remand nor it is his case that to the hearing of the police officer who brought him to the court premises, he had made confessional statement before PW5. On the facts and in the circumstances of the case, This Court is of the opinion that it is not probablised by the defence that the appellant was in custody of police officer while he had made extra judicial confession before PW5. The evidence relating to extra judicial confession inspires confidence of this Court. On this point, there is concurrent finding by the courts below and no case is made out by the appellant to interfere with the said finding in the present appeal. 16. The net result of the above discussion is that the prosecution has proved satisfactorily and beyond shadow of doubt following facts: (1) The deceased went missing in the evening of February 5, 1998 when she was playing near her house. (2) Her naked dead body was found at about 6 a.m. on February 8, 1998 lying on public way in front of house of Haji Khursheed. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/867974/ 13 Aftab Ahmad Anasari vs State Of Uttaranchal on 12 January, 2010 (3) She was subjected to rape and died a homicidal death. (4) The appellant was seen fleeing away from near the place where the dead body of the deceased was lying at about 4.30 a.m. on February 8, 1998. (5) Blood stained frock and blood stained underwear of the deceased concealed in the house of sister of the appellant, were recovered pursuant to voluntary disclosure statement made by the appellant while in police custody. (6) Underwear of the appellant seized during the course of investigation was found to be stained with blood and semen. (7) The appellant made extra judicial confession before PW5, Anand Swaroop. 17. The cumulative effect of the abovementioned facts taken together is conclusive in establishing the guilt of the appellant. The chain of circumstantial evidence is complete and does not leave any reasonable ground for conclusion consistent with the innocence of the appellant. The chain of circumstances is such as to show that within all human probability the rape and murder of the deceased were committed by the appellant and none else and he had also caused disappearance of evidence of those offences. This Court further notices that this Court in Vasa Chandrasekhar Rao vs. Ponna Satyanarayana & Anr. [(2000) 6 SCC 286] and Geetha vs. State of Karnataka [(2000) 10 SCC 72] while explaining the law relating to circumstantial evidence has ruled that where circumstances proved are put to the accused through his examination under Section 313 of the Code and the accused merely denies the same, then such denial would be an additional link in the chain of circumstances to bring home the charge against the accused. As indicated earlier, it is proved by cogent and reliable evidence that the appellant had committed rape on the deceased and thereafter murdered her. Here in this case, the incriminating circumstances proved were put to the appellant while recording his statement under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In his further statement, recorded under Section 313, the appellant has merely denied the same. Therefore, such denial on the part of the appellant and failure to explain the circumstances proved will have to be treated as an additional link in the chain of circumstances to bring home the charge against the appellant. The circumstances proved establish the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. 18. Thus, this Court does not find any substance in the appeal and the same is liable to be dismissed. Accordingly, the appeal fails and is dismissed. ................................J. [J.M. Panchal] ................................J. [T.S. Thakur] New Delhi; January 12, 2010.

Mair & Co vs Gordhandass Sagarmull on 30 November, 1950 The appellants, a firm of brokers, entered into a contrct for the sale and purchase of a quantity of jute under a ""sold note"" addressed to the respondents which they signed as ""A & Co., brokers"" and a ""bought note"" of the same date and for the same quantity of jute addressed to a third person in which also they signed as ""A & C0., brokers "". The"" sold note"" contained the usual arbitration clause under which all matters, questions, disputes, differences and/or claims, arising out of and/or concerning, and/or in connec- tion and/or in consequence of, or relating to, the contract ......... shall be referred to the arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce."" A dispute having arisen with regard to a matter which admittedly arose out of the contract evidenced by the sold note, the appellants referred the dispute for arbitration. The respondents raised before the arbitrators the further contention that as the appel- lants were only brokers they were not entitled to refer the matter to arbitration. The arbitrators made an award in favour of the appellants. The respondents made an applica- tion to the.High Court under the Indian Arbitration Act for setting aside the award: Held that, assuming that it was open to the respondents to raise this objection at that stage, inasmuch as this further dispute 793 was also one which turned on the true interpretation of the contract and the respondents must have recourse to the contract to establish their claim, this was also a dispute arising out of or concerning the contract and as such fell within the arbitration clause, and the award could not be set aside under the Indian Arbitration Act, 1940, on the ground that it was beyond jurisdiction and void.

The judgment of Fazl Ali and Patanja- li Sastri JJ. was delivered by FAZL ALI J.--This is an appeal from a judgment of a Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta in West Bengal, reversing the decision of a single Judge of that Court, who had refused to set aside an award given by the arbitration tribunal of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce on a submission made by the respondents. The facts of the case are as follows. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1041073/ 2 A.M. Mair & Co vs Gordhandass Sagarmull on 30 November, 1950 On the 25th January, 1946, the appellants entered into a contract with the respondents for the sale of 5,000 mounds of jute, which was evidenced by a ""sold note"" (Exhibit A), which is in the form of a letter addressed to the respond- ents, commencing with these words: ""We have this day sold by your order and for your account to the undersigned, etc."" The word ""undersigned"" admittedly refers to the appellants, and, at the end of the contract, below their signature, the word ""brokers"" is written. On the same day, a ""bought note"" (Exhibit B) was addressed by the appellants to the Bengal Jute Mill Company, with the following statement: ""We have this day bought by your order and. for your account from the undersigned, etc."" In this note also, the word ""undersigned"" refers to the appellants and underneath their signature, the word ""brokers"" appears, as in the ""sold note"" There are various provisions in the sold note, relating to delivery of jute, non-delivery of documents, nonacceptance of documents, claims, etc., but the most material provisions are to be found in paragraphs 10 and 11. paragraph 10 provides that the sellers may in certain cases be granted an extension of time for delivering the jute for a period not exceeding thirty days from the due date free of all penalties, and if the contract is not implemented within the extended peri- od, the buyers would be entitled to several options, one of them being to cancel the contract and charge the sellers the difference between the contract rate and the market rate on the day on which the option is declared. In the same para- graph, there is another provision to the following effect: - ""Sellers shall notify Buyers that goods will or will not be shipped within such extended period referred to in (a) and in the case of sellers intimating that they will be unable to ship within the extended time Buyers shall exercise their option within 5 working days of receiving notice and notify Sellers. In the absence of any such notice from Sellers it shall be deemed that the goods have not been shipped and Buyers shall exercise their option within 5 working days after expiration of extended date and notify Sellers."" The 11th paragraph provides among other things that ""all matters, questions, disputes, differences and/or claims arising out of and/or concerning and/or in connection and/or in consequence of or relating to this Contract whether or not obligations of either or both parties under this contract be subsisting at the time of such disputes and whether or not this contract has been terminated or purport- ed to be terminated or completed shall be referred to the arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce under the rules of its Tribunal of Arbitration for the time being in force and according to such rules the arbitration shall be conducted."" It is common ground that the respondents delivered 2,256 maunds of jute under the contract, but the balance of 2,744 maunds could not be delivered within the stipulated period, and, by mutual agreement, time was extended up to the 30th June, 1946. On the 2nd July, 1946, the respondents addressed a letter to the appellants stating that the balance of jute could not be despatched owing to lack of wagons, and ""exten- sion"" was requested for a period of one month. In reply to this letter, which was received by the appellants on or about the 3rd July, 1946, time was extended till the 31st Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1041073/ 3 A.M. Mair & Co vs Gordhandass Sagarmull on 30 November, 1950 July, 1946. On the same day on which the reply was received by the respondents, i.e., on the 9th July, 1946, they ad- dressed a letter to the appellants pointing out that the extension of time had not been intimated within the 5th working day as provided in the contract and therefore the contract was automatically cancelled. After this letter, some further correspondence followed between the two par- ties, and finally a bill of difference amounting to Rs. 4,116 was submitted by the appellants to the respondents, who, in their turn, denied their liability to pay the sum. The appellants thereupon claimed arbitration under clause 11 of the sold note and submitted the dispute between them and the respondents to the Bengal Chamber of Commerce. On the 6th February, 1947, the Tribunal of Arbitration made an award to the effect that the due date of contract had been extended by mutual agreement up to the 31st July, 1946, and accordingly the respondents should pay to the appellants a sum of Rs. 4,116 together with interest at the rate of 4% per annum from the 10th August, 1946, until the date of the award. A sum of Rs. 210 was also held to be payable by the respondents on account of costs. Nearly a year later, on the 19th February, 1949, a petition was presented by the re- spondents under the Indian Arbitration Act, 1940, to the High Court at Calcutta, in its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, praying inter alia that the award may be adjudged to be without jurisdiction and void and not binding on the respondents, and that it may be set aside. The main point raised by the respondents in the petition was that it was not open to the appellants to invoke the arbitration clause, as the Bengal Jute Mill Company and not the appellants were the real party to the contract and the appellants had acted as mere bro- kers. The appellants asserted in reply that the allegation made by the respondents in regard to there being no privity between them and the appellants was wrong, and in paragraph 16 of their affidavit they stated as follows :-- ""With regard to paragraph 7 of the petition I crave reference to the said contract for its true construction and effect. I say as I have already stated that according to the custom or usage or practice of the trade the respondent is entitled to charge brokerage and also to enforce the terms of the said contract."" The case was heard by Sinha J., who dismissed the peti- tion on the ground that the contract was directly between the respondents and the appellants. The learned Judge also observed that if the right of the appellants to enforce the contract depended upon the existence of custom it would have been necessary to take evidence and the arbitrators would have had jurisdiction to decide the question of the exist- ence of custom. The respondents being dissatisfied with the judgment of Sinha J., preferred an appeal, which was heard and disposed of by a Division Bench of the High Court consisting of the learned Chief Justice and Chakravarthi J. The learned Judges held that having regard to the fact that the appellants' own contention was that they had entered into the contract as brokers and were entitled to enforce its terms by reason of the usage or custom of the trade, it was not open to Sinha J. to treat them as principals, and the award was liable to be set aside on the ground that the arbitration tribunal had no jurisdiction to make an award at the instance of a per- son who was not a principal party to the contract. The appellants thereafter having obtained a certificate from the High Court under section 109 (c) of the Code of Civil Proce- dure, preferred this appeal. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1041073/ 4 A.M. Mair & Co vs Gordhandass Sagarmull on 30 November, 1950 It seems to us that this appeal can be disposed of on a short ground. We have carefully read the affidavit filed on behalf of the appellants in the trial court, and we are unable to hold that their case was that they were not par- ties to the contract or that they had asked the court to proceed on the sole ground that they were entitled to en- force the contract by virtue of the custom or usage of the trade. In our opinion, the position which was taken up by them may be summed up as follows :-- (1) They did not accept the allegations made by the respond- ents that they were not parties to any arbitration agreement with the respondents. (2) They asked the Court to construe the contract and its effect and asserted that they were entitled to enforce it. (3) They also stated that they were entitled to enforce the contract according to the custom or usage of the trade. The principal dispute raised in this case was whether the extension of time for delivery was granted within the time limited in the contract. That dispute is certainly covered by the arbitration clause. The further dispute that the brokers (appellants) were not parties to the contract in their own right as principals but entered into the contract only on behalf of the Bengal Jute Mill Company does not appear to have been raised until the matter went to the arbitrators. Assuming that at that stage it was open to the respondents to raise such an objection, after the other dispute which clearly fell within the arbitration clause was referred to the arbitrators, this further dispute is also one which turns upon the true interpretation of the con- tract, so that the respondents must have recourse to the contract to establish their claim that the appellants were not bound as principals while the latter say that they were: If that is the position, such a dispute, the determination of which turns on the true construction of the contract, would also seem to be a dispute, under or arising out of or concerning the contract. In a passage quoted in Heyman v. Darwins Ltd.(1), Lord Dunedin propounds the test thus:--"" If a party has to have recourse to the contract, that dispute is a dispute under the con- tract "". Here, the respondents must have recourse to the contract to establish their case and therefore it is a dispute falling within the arbitration clause. The error into which the learned Judges of the appellate Bench of the High Court appear to have fallen was their regarding the dispute raised by the respondent in respect of the position of the appellants under the contract as having the same consequence as a dispute as to the contract ever having been entered into. If, therefore, we come to the conclusion that both the disputes raised by the respondents fail within the scope of the arbitration clause, then there is an end of the matter, for the arbitrators would have jurisdiction to adjudicate on the disputes, and we are not concerned with any error of law or fact committed by them or any omission on their part to consider any of the matters. In this view, it would not be for us to determine the true construction of the contract and find out whether the respondents' contention is correct or not. Once the dispute is found to be within the scope of the arbitration clause, it is no part of the province of the court to enter into the merits of the dispute. In the result, we allow this appeal, set aside the judgment of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1041073/ 5 A.M.

Mukherjea, Chandrasekhara Aiyar JUDGMENT Fazl Ali, J. 1. I do not wish to express dissent from the order proposed by my learned brothers, as the order seems to be the logical consequence of the findings arrived at by the High Court in revision, which tend to throw very great doubt on one of the crucial questions in the case, namely, whether any theft was committed at all. It is clear that if there was no theft, the appellant's conviction for offences of which the main ingredient is theft, cannot be sustained. But I must confess that a careful reading of the judgment of the High Court has produced an uneasy feeling in my mind that the High Court has not bestowed the same care and attention upon the facts and the evidence of the case as they have received from the first two courts. There can be no doubt that where the interests of justice demand, the findings of the Courts, which normally deal with the facts of a case, may be reopened and may even be reversed by the High Court, but, before that is done, every item of relevant evidence upon which the findings to be reversed are based, should be carefully scrutinized and weighed. 2. In the present case, the conclusion arrived at by the learned Judges of the High Court that no crowbar was used in the commission of the alleged theft and that the marks on the safe were probably made in the course of investigation by the Superintendent of Police, seems to have been arrived at without considering and appreciating the evidence of K. C. Paricha, P. W. 23 -- the police, officer in charge of Koraput police station -- who visited the scene of theft soon after it was reported, and who states to have found the padlock of the chest missing, the locking arrangement of the embedded lock broken and the staple of the outer locking arrangement damaged. Again, the learned Judges of the High Court, while referring in the concluding part of their judgment to the fact that the confession of the appellant had received some corroboration, have relied on matters of a more or less trivial nature which afford little corroboration of any value, and entirely omitted to mention the recovery of two sums of money, which, according to the appellant himself, were part of the proceeds of the theft. Thus, a situation has arisen in which a confession which was found by the first two courts to have been corroborated in all material details, has become a meaningless statement, upon the findings arrived at by the High Court and the opinions expressed by it. B.K. Mukherjea, J. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35986/ 1 Arjuna Lal Misra vs The State on 30 November, 1950 3. I agree that the appeal should be allowed, and I concur substantially in the reasons given by my learned brother, Chandrasekhara Aiyar J., in his judgment. Chandrasekhara Aiyar, J. 4. This Criminal appeal comes up for our consideration on the strength of leave granted by the High Court of Orissa under Article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution of India. The order granting leave is a lengthy one and proceeds on the basis that the conviction of the appellant amounted to a miscarriage of justice on the facts and that there was failure to comply with the requirements of Section 342, Criminal P. C. 5. Arjun Misra, the appellant, was charged with another person Patnaik with offences under Sections 457/380/461, Penal Code, (house breaking by night to commit theft, the substantive offence of theft, and dishonestly breaking open a closed receptacle). The case for the prosecution was that these two persons entered into a room on 17-11-1946 (Sunday) in the District Police office at Koraput where the iron safe was kept, broke it open, and removed a sum of Rs. 2,290-14-0 from a net-bag in the safe. A confession was recorded from the appellant by a 1st Class Magistrate on 22-11-1946. This confession narrates many details about the plan for the commission of the offence, how it was actually committed, what happened to a crow-bar which was employed to break open the outer padlock of the safe as well as the embedded lock, and how the stolen currency notes were disposed of. As many as 26 witnesses were examined for the prosecution. 6. Patnaik, who was the co-accused with the appellant, denied all knowledge of the commission of the offence and asserted that P. W. 1, who was the Head Clerk in charge of the cash, must have been responsible for the misappropriation. He also set up the plea that at the time of the commission of the offence he was actually in a hospital. The appellant, when examined under Section 342, Criminal P. C, stated that the confession was made by him on the inducement of the C. I. D. Inspector examined as P. W. 12, to implicate Patnaik in order that he might himself be exonerated, and that what he stated was due to the Inspector's tutoring. 7. The Sub-Divisional Magistrate of Koraput, who tried the case in the first instance, held both the accused guilty of the three charges leveled against them and he sentenced them to rigorous imprisonment for one year and six months and a fine of Rs. 300 each for the offence under Section 457, Penal Code, and to rigorous imprisonment for one year and a fine of Rs. 200 each for the offence under Section 380, Penal Code. He did not pass any separate sentence for the offence under Section 461, Penal Code. 8. On appeal, the case was heard by the Additional Sessions Judge, Jeypore, and he confirmed the convictions and sentences. When the matter went before the High Court on revision, Patnaik was acquitted but Arjun Misra's revision was dismissed mainly on the ground that there was a confession by him. 9. In acquitting Patnaik, the High Court recorded its findings which destroyed the prosecution case almost in its entirety. The story that a crow-bar was used for breaking the outer padlock and forcing Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35986/ 2 Arjuna Lal Misra vs The State on 30 November, 1950 open the iron safe was not accepted as there were no marks of violence or forcible opening. It was probable according to the High Court that the safe was opened with the help of keys in the possession of their custodian or by someone else with his connivance. The keys were with P. W. 1, the Head Clerk, against whom strong suspicion fastened itself. The facts disclosed were more consistent with a natural opening of the safe than by the use of force with the aid of a crow-bar. The broken padlock and the crowbar were not traced or recovered. A small cash box in the iron safe which also contained money was left intact. As regards the 'alibi' pleaded by Patnaik, they held that there was the solid testimony of many witnesses that at the time of occurrence he was not on the scene of offence but at a hospital. 10. The prosecution case having been thus shattered in material parts, we have only to see if the retracted confession of the appellant can furnish any basis for his conviction. In using the confession for this purpose, the High Court did not advert to the substantial truth of the story as narrated by the accused; in fact, they could not. The learned Judges rest their view on a line of reasoning which is entirely at variance with the confession, and in fact, is outside its scope. The following extract from the judgment of the High Court may be quoted : ""The case against petitioner Arjuna Misra stands on a different footing. The confession that he made before the Magistrate, though subsequently retracted, finds corroboration from the other evidence recorded in the case. Being closely associated with Natabar Das (P. W. 1), he had knowledge of the contents of the iron safe. He had opportunities of pilfering the keys from P. W. 1's house and making false keys. He was hand in glove with and was in the confidence of P. W. 1. He can be regarded as 'particeps criminis' with P. W. 1. The suggestion of the accused P. J. Patnaik that P. W. 1 was heavily involved in debts and was short of funds and that he therefore resorted to the story of burglary to cover up his acts of misappropriation, cannot be brushed aside as untenable. I am loath to believe that the padlock or the iron safe itself was broken open as alleged by the prosecution with the help of a crowbar which was never recovered. The marks of violence alleged to have been noticed on the iron chest are probably those that were made at the instance of the S. P. while he was conducting a sound test. The removal of the net bag alone is also a circumstance which does not appear to be natural. If there had been a burglary, why the small cash box was left untouched and why only the bag was removed defies explanation. The find of a two rupee note near about the iron safe also raises a grave suspicion that the whole affair was a made up job, having regard to the fact that the notes in the iron safe were stitched. The discrepancy in the evidence with regard to the net bag is another circumstance which seems to be inconsistent with the natural course of events. According to one version the net bag was inside the chest lying empty; while according to another version it was found in the room. The presence of P. W. 1 in the office on the day of occurrence which was a Sunday and the evidence that he was there till after 5 o'clock lends support to the inference that he was himself the thief or an active participant or abettor of the theft. It may be that he left the padlock and the lock of the iron safe open and put the seal merely to divert attention and thus facilitate the removal of the cash by the petitioner Arjun Misra soon after P. W. 1 left Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/35986/ 3 Arjuna Lal Misra vs The State on 30 November, 1950 the office a little later than 5 p.m. In view of the apparent contradictions in the evidence regarding the borrowing of a crow-bar by Arjun and its non-recovery by the police, I am not inclined to accept the story that a crow-bar was actually used to force the safe open."" 11. The theory that the appellant may have been associated with P. W. 1 (the Head Clerk) who was probably the real thief and who had custody of the keys, is not the case for the prosecution. It would be apparent therefore that the footing on which they proceeded to convict the appellant is totally different from what is disclosed in or by the confession. No point is made by the High Court of the recovery of part of the stolen moneys as the result of statements made by the appellant and this is possibly for two reasons. One is that apart from the confession, there is nothing to show that the currency-notes recovered from the bush and cow-dung heap were the currency notes in the iron safe at the time of the commission of the offence; and the second is that the appellant was not asked specifically what explanation he had to give about the recoveries. 12. If the offences of house-breaking and theft fail against Patnaik, the same result has to follow as regards the appellant also. The confession has been shown to be devoid of truth in substantial particulars and there is no safe substratum on which we can hold the appellant guilty. It is true that in the concluding portion of the judgment of the High Court there is the observation that even apart from the confession there was sufficient evidence to prove the guilt of Arjun Misra. We are not prepared, however, to attach much weight to this remark, when the evidence has not been indicated and all that is relied on in the next sentence is the appellant's absence from the police office at the time of the roll call on 27-11-1946. 13. Accepting the version of the High Court about the occurrence, as we must, we have before us a case where the conclusion of guilt rests solely on a retracted confession, not only uncorroborated in material particulars, but untrue in many parts. Such a conviction is opposed to law and cannot be allowed to stand. 14. It becomes unnecessary in these circumstances to consider the question whether the omission, in the examination under Section 342, Criminal P. C., to ask the accused specifically what explanation he had to give about the recovery of currency-notes from two places, is so material as to vitiate the trial altogether. 15. The convictions and the sentences imposed on the appellant are set aside and the appellant will stand acquitted of the charges. We direct him to be set at liberty.

Singhvi Bench: Asok Kumar Ganguly, G.S. Singhvi REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO. 55 OF 2010 (Arising out of SLP (C) No. 2991 of 2008) Abdul Razak (D) Through L.Rs. and others ... Appellants Versus Mangesh Rajaram Wagle and others ... Respondents J U D G M E N T G.S. Singhvi, J. 1. Leave granted. 2. The appellants are aggrieved by the order of the learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court, Goa Bench whereby he allowed the writ petition filed by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 and granted their prayer for striking off the additional written statement filed by the appellants after their impleadment as legal representatives of defendant No.2 - Abdul Razak. 3. Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 filed suit in the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division), Panaji (hereinafter described as `the trial Court') for declaring them as lawful tenants of suit premises and also for restraining the defendants - Suresh D. Naik (respondent No.3 herein) and Abdul Razak, who died during the pendency of the suit and is being represented by his legal representatives (appellants herein) to remove the lock allegedly put by respondent No.3 on the suit premises along with materials dumped there. An alternative prayer made by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 was for recovery of possession of suit premises in case it was held that they had already been dispossessed. The substance of the case set up by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 before the trial Court is that the suit premises were let out to their predecessor Shri Rajaram D. Wagle in 1951 by one Jussab Abdul Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1086480/ 1 Abdul Razak (D) Thr.Lrs. & Ors vs Mangesh Rajaram Wagle & Ors on 7 January, 2010 Karim at a monthly rent of Rs.15/- which was subsequently increased to Rs.25/-; that the owner-cum-landlord sold the premises to Abdul Kadar Haji Jaffar (grandfather of appellant Nos.2, 3, 4 and 6); that Rajaram D. Wagle died on 29.4.1981 and after his death they have been using the suit premises for parking their cars; that on 5.1.1992, respondent No.3 broke open the lock of the suit premises and dumped his goods i.e., boxes of liquor bottles, but the same were removed by the police on a complaint made by respondent No.1 in that regard; that on 8.1.1992, respondent No. 3 again broke open the lock and forcibly occupied the suit premises and this time the police did not act on the complaint made by them. 4. In his written statement, respondent No.3 not only denied the averments contained in the plaint that he had illegally taken possession of the suit premises after breaking open the locks put by respondent Nos. 1 and 2, but also pleaded that after being forced to leave Kuwait in the wake of war, he came to India and is doing business of distribution of liquor in the suit premises on the basis of permission accorded by defendant No.2 - Abdul Razak, who was a family friend. Respondent No.3 further pleaded that the competent authority granted him excise licence after being satisfied that the suit premises were suitable for doing business in liquor. 5. Abdul Razak (predecessor of the appellants) filed a separate written statement. He largely denied the averments contained in the plaint and pleaded that much before his death, Shri Rajaram D. Wagle had voluntarily surrendered the suit premises and thereafter, respondent No.3 was allowed to occupy the same for conducting business of distribution of liquor. 6. Abdul Razak died during the pendency of the suit. Thereupon, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 filed an application for impleading his widow (appellant No.1), son and three daughters (appellant Nos. 2, 3 4 and 6) and two son-in- laws (appellant Nos. 5 and 7) in place of the deceased. Appellant Nos. 3, 4 and 6 objected to the impleadment of the son-in-laws by stating that they are non- Goans and are not governed by personal law relating to properties in Goa. They also objected to the impleadment of appellant Nos. 1 and 3 i.e., the widow and son of the deceased on the ground that the suit premises had been allotted to them in the inventory proceedings. 7. By order dated 10.12.2003, the learned trial Court overruled all the objections raised by appellant Nos. 3, 4 and 6 and allowed the application of respondent Nos. 1 and 2 by observing that joining of the widow, son and son-in- laws of the deceased will not prejudice the daughters and they will be entitled to take defence suitable to their plea. 8. In furtherance of the observation made by the trial Court in the aforementioned order, the appellants filed additional written statement dated 3.3.2004, the sum and substance of which is that in the inventory proceedings No.80/1989/A held in the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division) at Panaji after the death of Abdul Kadar Haji Jaffar and his wife, the suit property was allotted to their grand-daughters (appellant Nos.3, 4 and 6) because other heirs did not object to this. The appellants pleaded that in the meeting held on 10.4.1990, members of the Family Council unanimously agreed for allotment of the properties and this was approved by the Court vide order dated 26.9.1990. A reference was also made to Special Civil Suit No. 89/99/B filed by appellant Nos. 3, 4 and 6 in the trial Court for grant of permanent injunction on the ground that respondent Nos. 1 and 2 had filed Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1086480/ 2 Abdul Razak (D) Thr.Lrs. & Ors vs Mangesh Rajaram Wagle & Ors on 7 January, 2010 Execution Application No.15/98/A for being put in possession of the suit premises in execution of order dated 17.4.1997 passed in an application for temporary and mandatory injunction. According to the appellants, the trial Court allowed the execution application and the appeal and special leave petition filed by them were dismissed by the High Court and this Court respectively. In the additional written statement, it was also averred that son-in-laws of late Abdul Razak have no right, title or interest in the suit property and, therefore, they cannot be treated as his legal representatives. The impleadment of appellant No.2 was also questioned on the premise that he has no right in the suit property. 9. After filing of the additional written statement, the trial Court framed the following additional issues: 1. Whether the plaintiffs prove that defendants illegally damaged and destroyed the two ramps existing adjacent to the entrance of the suit premises? 2. Whether the plaintiffs prove that the suit filed by them for declaration of tenancy right is maintainable for want of the owners of the suit premises? 3. Whether the plaintiffs prove that Sajeeda Razak, Matheen I Saint, Mohammad Arif Razak Ajaz Ahmed are legal representatives of deceased defendant No.2 impleaded in the suit as defendants 2(i), 2(ii), 2(v) and 2(vii) respectively. What relief? What order? 10. Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 did not object to the taking on record of the additional written statement filed by the appellants or framing of the additional issues and led evidence, the recording of which was completed during 2006. Thereafter, the appellants produced their evidence. When the case was fixed for cross-examination of appellant No.3, who is one of the witnesses cited by the appellants, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 filed application dated 9.10.2007 for striking off the additional written statement by asserting that the legal representatives of the deceased defendant No.2 do not have right under the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) to file such written statement and, in any case, they cannot be allowed to raise new plea about their title to the suit premises. Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 further pleaded that the additional written statement is liable to be struck off because before filing the same, the appellants did not seek leave of the court. In their reply, the appellants pleaded that the additional written statement was filed with a view to bring on record the facts relating to the inventory proceedings and the same cannot be struck off because the applicants have failed to make out a case for exercise of power by the court under Order VI Rule 16 CPC. 11. The trial Court dismissed the application of respondent Nos. 1 and 2 by observing that leave of the Court will be presumed to have been granted because the additional written statement was filed on 3.3.2004 and respondent Nos. 1 and 2 had not objected to the same. As regards their plea that new or inconsistent case was sought to be set up by the appellants, the trial Court observed that this point can be considered at the time of deciding the case on merits. The trial Court then referred to Order VI Rule 16 and held that respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have not been able to make out a case for Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1086480/ 3 Abdul Razak (D) Thr.Lrs. & Ors vs Mangesh Rajaram Wagle & Ors on 7 January, 2010 striking off the additional written statement. 12. Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 challenged the order of the trial Court in W.P. No. 58/2008. By the impugned order, the learned Single Judge allowed the writ petition and held that the legal representatives of deceased defendant No.2 could have taken a plea which was appropriate to their character as legal representatives, but they were not entitled to take a plea derogatory to the plea already taken. The learned Single Judge further held that the trial Court was not justified in dismissing the application on the ground of delay, which could have been compensated by imposing cost. 13. We have heard learned counsel for the parties. Three questions which merit consideration by this Court are - (i) What is the effect of delay in filing the application by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 for striking off the additional written statement? (ii) Whether the High Court could pass an order for striking off the additional written statement despite the fact that respondent Nos. 1 and 2 failed to make out a case for exercise of power by the court under Order VI Rule 16 CPC? (iii) Whether the High Court was justified in setting aside the order of the trial Court without being satisfied that the same was vitiated by an error of jurisdiction or an error of law apparent on the face of the record and that such error resulted in substantial failure of justice? Re: (i): 14. Undisputedly, the additional written statement was filed on 3.3.2004 and the same was taken on record without any objection from respondent Nos. 1 and 2, who did not even seek leave of the court to file further pleadings in the light of the additional written statement. Although, the parties have not furnished details of the proceedings of the case for next about two years, this much is clear that respondent Nos.1 and 2 led evidence in support of their case and completed the same in 2006. In the absence of any contrary evidence, it can be reasonably and legitimately presumed that respondent Nos. 1 and 2 must have produced their evidence keeping in view the pleadings contained in the additional written statement. They filed application for striking out the additional written statement after a long time gap of three years and six months without explaining as to why they did not object to the taking on record of the additional written statement and framing of additional issues in 2004 and why they chose to lead evidence knowing fully well that after their impleadment as legal representatives of Abdul Razak, appellant Nos. 3, 4 and 6 had pleaded that they had become owners of the property by virtue of the orders passed in the inventory proceedings. The learned Single Judge casually brushed aside and rejected the plea of the appellants that the application filed by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 for striking off the additional written statement was highly belated and no explanation worth the name had been offered for the same by observing that the trial Court could have compensated them by imposing cost. In our view, the learned Single Judge should have seriously examined the issue of delay in the backdrop of the facts that respondent Nos. 1 and 2 did Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1086480/ 4 Abdul Razak (D) Thr.Lrs. & Ors vs Mangesh Rajaram Wagle & Ors on 7 January, 2010 not object to the taking on record the additional written statement or framing of additional issues and led their evidence and further that the application was filed after almost one year of completion of their evidence. The observation made by the learned Single Judge that the proceedings of the suit will be delayed if the legal representatives of the deceased defendant are allowed to take the plea based on their title is neither here nor there. It is true that the suit filed by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 is pending for last about 17 years, but there is nothing on record to show that the appellants or their predecessors are responsible for the delay. The death of Abdul Razak was not a predictable event, the happening of which could be averted by the parties or the court. In any case, the appellants cannot be blamed for the delay, if any, in the trial of the case. As a matter of fact, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have delayed the proceedings for over two years by filing frivolous application for striking off the additional written statement which, as mentioned above, was taken on record in March, 2004. Re: (ii): 15. Order VI Rule 16 CPC which empowers the Court to strike out the pleadings reads thus: ""Striking out pleadings. - The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any matter in any pleading-- (a) which may be unnecessary, scandalous, frivolous or vexatious, or (b) which may tend to prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the suit, or (c) which is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court."" 16. A reading of the plain language of the above reproduced provisions makes it clear that the court's power to strike out any pleading at any stage of the proceedings can be exercised in either of the three eventualities i.e., where the pleadings are considered by the court unnecessary, scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; or where the court is satisfied that the pleadings tend to prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the suit or which is otherwise considered as an abuse of the court. 17. Normally, a court cannot direct or dictate the parties as to what should be their pleading and how they should prepare their pleadings. If the parties do not violate any statutory provision, they have the freedom to make appropriate averments and raise arguable issues. The court can strike off the pleadings only if it is satisfied that the same are unnecessary, scandalous, frivolous or vexatious or tend to prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the suit or the court is satisfied that suit is an abuse of the process of the court. Since the striking off pleadings has serious adverse impact on the rights of the concerned party, the power to do so has to be exercised with great care and circumspection. In Knowles v. Roberts (1888) 38 Ch D, 263, Boven, L.J. Observed: ""It seems to me that the rule that the Court is not to dictate to parties how they should frame their case, is one that ought always to be preserved sacred. But that rule is, of course, subject to this modification and limitation, that the parties must not offend against the rules of pleading which have been laid down by the law; and if a Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1086480/ 5 Abdul Razak (D) Thr.Lrs. & Ors vs Mangesh Rajaram Wagle & Ors on 7 January, 2010 party introduces a pleading which is unnecessary, and it tends to prejudice, embarrass and delay the trial of the action, it then becomes a pleading which is beyond his right. It is a recognized principle that a defendant may claim ex debito justitiae to have the plaintiff's claim presented in an intelligible form, so that he may not be embarrassed in meeting it; and the Court ought to be strict even to severity in taking care to prevent pleadings from degenerating into the old oppressive pleadings of the Court of Chancery."" 18. The above reproduced observations have been quoted with approval in Sathi Vijay Kumar v. Tota Singh and others (2006) 13 SCC 353. In that case, the order passed by the High Court deleting paragraphs 11, 12 and 13(a) from the election petition filed by the appellant was questioned before this Court on the ground that the case does not fall within the ambit of Order VI Rule 16. This Court first held that the provisions of Order VI Rule 16 CPC are applicable to election petitions. The Court then referred to the earlier judgments in Roop Lal Sathi v. Nachhattar Singh Gill (1982) 3 SCC 487, K.K. Modi v. K.N. Modi (1998) 3 SCC 573, Union Bank of India v. Naresh Kumar (1996) 6 SCC 660 and held that the power to strike out pleading is extraordinary in nature and must be exercised by the Court sparingly and with extreme care, caution and circumspection. 19. In this case, the learned trial Court did make a reference to the provisions of Order VI Rule 16 and held that the application made by the plaintiffs (respondent Nos. 1 and 2 herein) does not fall in either clauses of Rule 16. The learned Single Judge of the High Court did not even bother to notice Order VI Rule 16 what to say of considering its applicability to the pleadings contained in the additional written statement and granted the prayer of respondent Nos. 1 and 2 by assuming that the plea raised by the appellants was inconsistent with the defence set up by their predecessor-in-interest. In our opinion, the learned Single Judge did not have the jurisdiction to direct striking off the additional written statement without being satisfied that respondent Nos. 1 and 2 were able to make out a case for exercise of power by the court under either of three clauses of Order VI Rule 16 CPC. Re: (iii) : 20. Although, from the record produced before this Court it is not clear whether respondent Nos. 1 and 2 had filed writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or they had invoked supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 227 of the Constitution, but a reading of the impugned order does not leave any manner of doubt that while granting relief to respondent Nos. 1 and 2, the learned Single Judge did not keep in mind the guiding principles laid down by this Court for exercise of power under Articles 226 or 227 of the Constitution. It seems to us that the learned Single Judge decided the matter by assuming that he was hearing an appeal against the order of the trial Court. If this was not so, the learned Single Judge was duty bound to first consider whether he was called upon to exercise power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India or under Article 227 thereof. If respondent Nos. 1 and 2 had invoked the High Court's jurisdiction under Article 226, then the learned Single Judge ought to have considered whether the trial Court committed a jurisdictional error by refusing to strike off the additional written statement filed by the appellants or it was a case of failure on the part of the trial Court to exercise the power vested in it under Order Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1086480/ 6 Abdul Razak (D) Thr.Lrs. & Ors vs Mangesh Rajaram Wagle & Ors on 7 January, 2010 VI Rule 16 CPC or the order under challenge was vitiated by an error of law apparent on the face of the record or there was violation of the rules of natural justice. In either case, the learned Single Judge was also required to consider whether there has been substantial failure of justice or manifest injustice has been caused to respondent Nos. 1 and 2 on account of the trial Court's refusal to strike off the additional written statement. These are the parameters laid down by this Court in Syed Yakoob v. K.S. Radhakrishnan AIR 1964 SC 477. If the petition filed by respondent Nos. 1 and 2 was under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, then the learned Single Judge should have taken note of the often quoted judgment in Surya Dev Rai v. Ram Chander Rai (2003) 6 SCC 675, in which a two-Judge Bench, after threadbare analysis of Articles 226 or 227 of the Constitution and considering large number of judicial precedents on the subject, recorded the following conclusions: ""(1) Amendment by Act 46 of 1999 with effect from 1-7-2002 in Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure cannot and does not affect in any manner the jurisdiction of the High Court under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution. (2) Interlocutory orders, passed by the courts subordinate to the High Court, against which remedy of revision has been excluded by CPC Amendment Act 46 of 1999 are nevertheless open to challenge in, and continue to be subject to, certiorari and supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court. (3) Certiorari, under Article 226 of the Constitution, is issued for correcting gross errors of jurisdiction i.e. when a subordinate court is found to have acted (i) without jurisdiction -- by assuming jurisdiction where there exists none, or (ii) in excess of its jurisdiction -- by overstepping or crossing the limits of jurisdiction, or (iii) acting in flagrant disregard of law or the rules of procedure or acting in violation of principles of natural justice where there is no procedure specified, and thereby occasioning failure of justice. (4) Supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution is exercised for keeping the subordinate courts within the bounds of their jurisdiction. When a subordinate court has assumed a jurisdiction which it does not have or has failed to exercise a jurisdiction which it does have or the jurisdiction though available is being exercised by the court in a manner not permitted by law and failure of justice or grave injustice has occasioned thereby, the High Court may step in to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction. (5) Be it a writ of certiorari or the exercise of supervisory jurisdiction, none is available to correct mere errors of fact or of law unless the following requirements are satisfied: (i) the error is manifest and apparent on the face of the proceedings such as when it is based on clear ignorance or utter disregard of the provisions of law, and (ii) a grave injustice or gross failure of justice has occasioned thereby. (6) A patent error is an error which is self-evident i.e. which can be perceived or demonstrated without involving into any lengthy or complicated argument or a Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1086480/ 7 Abdul Razak (D) Thr.Lrs. & Ors vs Mangesh Rajaram Wagle & Ors on 7 January, 2010 long-drawn process of reasoning. Where two inferences are reasonably possible and the subordinate court has chosen to take one view, the error cannot be called gross or patent. (7) The power to issue a writ of certiorari and the supervisory jurisdiction are to be exercised sparingly and only in appropriate cases where the judicial conscience of the High Court dictates it to act lest a gross failure of justice or grave injustice should occasion. Care, caution and circumspection need to be exercised, when any of the abovesaid two jurisdictions is sought to be invoked during the pendency of any suit or proceedings in a subordinate court and the error though calling for correction is yet capable of being corrected at the conclusion of the proceedings in an appeal or revision preferred thereagainst and entertaining a petition invoking certiorari or supervisory jurisdiction of the High Court would obstruct the smooth flow and/or early disposal of the suit or proceedings. The High Court may feel inclined to intervene where the error is such, as, if not corrected at that very moment, may become incapable of correction at a later stage and refusal to intervene would result in travesty of justice or where such refusal itself would result in prolonging of the lis. (8) The High Court in exercise of certiorari or supervisory jurisdiction will not convert itself into a court of appeal and indulge in reappreciation or evaluation of evidence or correct errors in drawing inferences or correct errors of mere formal or technical character. (9) In practice, the parameters for exercising jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari and those calling for exercise of supervisory jurisdiction are almost similar and the width of jurisdiction exercised by the High Courts in India unlike English courts has almost obliterated the distinction between the two jurisdictions. While exercising jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari, the High Court may annul or set aside the act, order or proceedings of the subordinate courts but cannot substitute its own decision in place thereof. In exercise of supervisory jurisdiction the High Court may not only give suitable directions so as to guide the subordinate court as to the manner in which it would act or proceed thereafter or afresh, the High Court may in appropriate cases itself make an order in supersession or substitution of the order of the subordinate court as the court should have made in the facts and circumstances of the case."" 21. We regretfully note that while deciding the writ petition filed by respondent Nos. 1 and 2, the learned Single Judge did not keep in mind the principles laid down by this Court in the aforementioned two judgments and decided the same as if he was exercising appellate jurisdiction of the High Court. There have been several other instances in which different High Courts have passed orders in exercise of power under Articles 226 or 227 of the Constitution of India disregarding the limitations identified and indicated by this Court in several decisions on the exercise of that power. We hope and trust that in future the High Courts would keep in view the limitations of certiorari jurisdiction/supervisory jurisdiction and refrain from deciding the writ petitions filed under Article 226 or petitions/applications filed under Article 227 of the Constitution as if they are adjudicating appeals filed against the orders of the lower courts or other judicial/quasi judicial bodies/authorities. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1086480/ 8 Abdul Razak (D) Thr.Lrs. & Ors vs Mangesh Rajaram Wagle & Ors on 7 January, 2010 22. Before concluding, we deem it appropriate to consider the argument of the learned counsel for respondent Nos. 1 and 2 that the pleadings contained in the additional written statement filed by the appellants were inconsistent with and beyond the scope of the defence set up by Abdul Razak in the original written statement and the trial Court was duty bound to discard the same in view of the provision contained in Order 22 Rule 4 CPC and the judgments of this Court in J.C. Chatterjee v. Sri Kishan (1972) 2 SCC 461, Bal Kishan v. Om Parkash (1986) 4 SCC 155 and Vidyawati v. Man Mohan (1995) 5 SCC 431. In our opinion, the argument of the learned counsel is meritless and deserves to be rejected. In the plaint filed by them, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 did not make a mention of the inventory proceedings held after the death of Abdul Kadar Hazi Jaffar and his wife and order dated 26.9.1990 passed by the trial Court. In his written statement, Abdul Razak pleaded that before his death, the tenant Shri Rajaram D. Wagle had surrendered possession of the premises to him and that the plaintiffs had nothing to do with the suit premises. He further pleaded that the suit premises were given to defendant No.2 for conducting business of distribution of liquor. There is nothing in the written statement of Abdul Razak from which it can be inferred that he has claimed ownership over the suit property. After they were brought on record as legal representatives of late Abdul Razak, the appellants filed additional written statement incorporating therein the plea that the suit property had become subject matter of inventory proceedings No.80/89/A and the same was allotted to the daughters of Abdul Razak i.e. appellant Nos.3, 4 and 6. The appellants also pleaded that in the meeting of the Family Council held on 10.4.1990, a unanimous decision was taken for allotment of the properties and the same was approved by the trial Court vide order dated 26.9.1990. According to the appellants, Abdul Razak was looking after the suit property because at the time of death of his parents, appellant Nos. 3, 4 and 6 were minor. Therefore, it cannot be said that the plea raised by the appellants is inconsistent with the averments contained in the original written statement by Abdul Razak. Order 22 Rule 4(1) and (2) CPC on which reliance has been placed by learned counsel for respondent Nos. 1 and 2 reads as under: ""4. Procedure in case of death of one of several defendants or of sole defendant.--(1) Where one of two or more defendants dies and the right to sue does not survive against the surviving defendant or defendants alone, or a sole defendant or sole surviving defendant dies and the right to sue survives, the court, on an application made in that behalf, shall cause the legal representative of the deceased defendant to be made a party and shall proceed with the suit. (2) Any person so made a party may make any defence appropriate to his character as legal representative of the deceased defendant."" 23. In J.C. Chatterjee's case, this Court interpreted the above reproduced provision and held: Under sub-clause (ii) of Rule 4 of Order 22 of the Civil Procedure Code any person so made a party as a legal representative of the deceased, respondent was entitled to make any defence appropriate to his character as legal representative of the deceased respondent. In other words, the heirs and the legal representatives could urge all contentions which the deceased could have urged except only those which were personal to the deceased. Indeed this does not prevent the legal representatives from Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1086480/ 9 Abdul Razak (D) Thr.Lrs. & Ors vs Mangesh Rajaram Wagle & Ors on 7 January, 2010 setting up also their own independent title, in which case there could be no objection to the court impleading them not merely as the legal representatives of the deceased but also in their personal capacity avoiding thereby a separate suit for a decision on the independent title. 24. In Bal Kishan's case, the proposition laid down in J.C. Chatterjee's case was reiterated, but its width was limited by observing that the same would apply only to those cases where the Court hearing the case has jurisdiction to try the issues relating to independent title also. The facts of Bal Kishan's case were that respondent No. 1 therein filed a petition for eviction of the tenant by alleging that the latter had sublet the premises without his consent. During the pendency of the petition, the tenant Musadi Lal died. Thereupon, the appellant Bal Kishan filed an application for being brought on record as legal representative of the deceased. The Rent Controller allowed the application. Thereafter, the appellant filed additional written statement asserting therein that the premises in question being residential and commercial, the legal heir of the tenant could not be treated as a tenant as defined under Section 2(h) of the Haryana Urban (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1973 and that possession of such legal heir of the tenant would be that of a trespasser. He accordingly prayed for dismissal of the eviction petition. The Rent Controller rejected the appellant's plea and allowed the eviction petition by holding that Musadi Lal had sublet the premises to Med Ram without his consent. The appeal and revision filed by the appellant were dismissed by the Appellate Authority and the High Court respectively. Before this Court, the appellant relied upon the ratio of J.C. Chatterjee's case and argued that he was entitled to raise an additional plea that the eviction petition was not maintainable. While rejecting this plea, this Court held: But in the instant case the appellant cannot claim the benefit of the above decision for two reasons. First, the appellant had not been brought on record as a respondent in the eviction petition in his personal capacity but had been brought on record only as the legal representative of Musadi Lal. Secondly, in the circumstances of this case, even if a prayer had been made to bring the appellant on record in his personal capacity, the Rent Controller could not have allowed the application and permitted him to raise the plea of independent title because such a plea would oust the jurisdiction of the Rent Controller to try the case itself. The observations made in the Jagdish Chander Chatterjee case have to be confined to only those cases where the court hearing the case has jurisdiction to try the issues relating to independent title also. The Rent Controller, who had no jurisdiction to pass the decree for possession against a trespasser could not have, therefore, impleaded the appellant as a respondent to the petition for eviction in his independent capacity. (emphasis supplied) 25. In Vidyawati's case, this Court considered the question whether a person impleaded as a legal representative of the deceased defendant can independently claim title to and interest in the property under a will. It was contended by the appellant that claim of the original defendant and that of the legal representative are founded on the will executed by Champawati and the courts below were not right in refusing to permit her to file additional written statement. While approving Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1086480/ 10 Abdul Razak (D) Thr.Lrs. & Ors vs Mangesh Rajaram Wagle & Ors on 7 January, 2010 the view taken by the courts below, this Court observed ""whether the petitioner has independent right, title and interest de hors the claim of the first defendant is a matter to be gone into at a later proceeding. It is true that when the petitioner was impleaded as a party-defendant, all rights under Order XXII Rule 4(2), and defences available to the deceased defendant became available to her. In addition, if the petitioner had any independent right, title or interest in the property, then she had to get herself impleaded in the suit as a party-defendant. Thereafter, she could resist the claim made by the plaintiff or challenge the decree that may be passed in the suit. For taking this view, the Court relied upon the judgments in J.C. Chatterjee's case and Bal Kishan's case. 26. The judgments of Bal Kishan's case and Vidyawati's case are clearly distinguishable. In the first case, the earlier judgment in J.C. Chatterjee's case, which substantially supports the appellants was distinguished on the ground that the plea raised by the impleaded legal representative of the tenant was inconsistent with his defence and, if accepted, the same would result in ouster of the jurisdiction of the Rent Controller. In the second case also, the Court found that the plea raised by the appellant, who was impleaded as legal representative of the defendant that she had independent title under the will executed by Champawati was not in consonance with the plea taken by the original defendant. However, as discussed in the earlier part of the judgment, the claim made by the appellants is in no way inconsistent with or derogatory to the defence set up by Abdul Razak. In any case, once the additional written statement filed by the appellants was taken on record without any objection by respondent Nos. 1 and 2, who also led their evidence keeping in view the pleadings of the additional written statement, the High Court was not at all justified in allowing the application filed for striking off the additional written statement and that too without even adverting to Order VI Rule 16 CPC and considering whether respondent Nos. 1 and 2 were able to make out a case for exercise of power by the court under that provision. 27. In the result, the appeal is allowed. The impugned order of the High Court is set aside and the one passed by the trial Court is restored. Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 shall pay cost of Rs.25,000/- to the appellants for burdening them with unnecessary litigation. ........................................J. [G.S.

This authority will remain in force for one month from date."" In pursuance of this contract the appellant found two persons ready and willing to pur- chase the property for Rs. 1,10,000 on the 2nd June and by letters exchanged with them he purported to conclude the contract for the sale of the propertY, and on the 3rd June communicated the same to the respondent. The respondent, however, cancelled the authority of the appellant on the 9th June and on the same date entered into an agreement with a nominee of the said persons for a sale of the property Rs. 1,05,000 and eventually executed a conveyance in their favour for Rs. 1,05,000. The appellant instituted a suit against the respondent for Rs. 6,000. Held, per KANIA C.J., FAZL ALl, PATANJALI SASTRI and DAS JJ.--(i) that a house or estate agent is in a different position from a broker at the Stock Exchange owing to the peculiarities of the property with which he has to deal, and an owner employing an estate agent should not, in the ab- sence of clear words to that effect, be taken to have autho- rised him to conclude a contract of sale; but the lack of such authority is not inconsistent with an understanding that the agent is not to be entitled to his commission unless the owner and the purchaser introduced by the agent 31 carried the transaction to completion; (ii) that even if the commission note in the present case were to be construed as making payment of commission conditional on the completion of the transaction, the appellant having ""negotiated the sale ""and ""secured buyers"" who made a firm offer to buy for Rs. 1,10,000, acquired the right to the payment of commis- sion on the basis of that price subject only to the condi- tion that the buyers should complete the transaction of purchase and sale; and as this condition was fulfilled when the buyers eventually purchased the property in question, the appellant's right to commission on that basis became absolute, and could not be affected by the circumstance that the respondent for some reason of his own sold the property at a lower price. MAHAJAN J.--Under the terms of the commission note in the present case the appellant had authority to enter into a binding contract on behalf of the defendant, and, as he had entered into such a contract he was entitled to the commis- Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 2 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 sion of Rs. 6,000 according to the terms of the commission note.

PATANJALI SASTRI J.--This is an appeal by special leave from a judgment and decree of the High Court of Judicature at Fort William in West Bengal dated 5th January, 1948, which varied a judgment and decree passed by a single Judge on 11th June, 1945, on the Original Side of the same Court. The appellant who is carrying on business as an estate broker in Calcutta was employed by the respondent on the terms mentioned in a commission letter dated the 5th May, 1943, to ""negotiate the sale"" of premises No. 27, Amratolla Street, Calcutta, belonging to him. In pursuance of this contract the appellant found two persons who were ready and willing to purchase the property for Rs. 1,10,000, and by letters exchanged with them on 2nd June, 1943, he purported to conclude a contract for the sale of the property and communicated the same to the respondent by a letter of even date. The respondent, however, entered into an agreement on 9th June, 1943, with a nominee of the said persons for the sale of the property for Rs. 1,05,000 and eventually execut- ed a Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 3 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 conveyance in their favour on 8th December, 1943. Thereupon the appellant brought the suit alleging that the contract concluded by him with the purchasers for Rs. 1,10,000 on the 2nd June, 1943, was binding on the respond- ent and claimed that he was entitled to the payment of Rs. 6,000 as remuneration in accordance with the terms of his employment as he had done all that he was required to do on behalf of the respondent. In the alternative he claimed the same sum as damages for breach of contract. In defence to the suit the respondent pleaded, inter alia, that the appel- lant had no authority to conclude a binding contract for sale with any one, that the purchasers refused to complete the transaction alleging that they had been induced by the fraudulent misrepresentation of the appellant to agree to a price of Rs. 1,10,000, that the subsequent sale was effected independently of the appellant, and that the appellant was not therefore entitled to any remuneration or damages, Gentle J. who tried the suit found that the terms of the appellant's employment did not authorise him to conclude a contract of sale and that the letters of 2nd June, 1943, did not effect a contract of sale binding on the respondent. The learned Judge, however, rejected the respondent's case that the purchasers refused to purchase on the ground of any fraudulent misrepresentation by the appellant and that the negotiations were later resumed afresh directly between the respondent and the purchasers, and came to the conclusion that the agreement to sell of the 9th June, 1943, and the subsequent conveyance of 8th December, 1943, were due solely to the efforts of the appellant in bringing the parties together as potential buyers and seller. The learned Judge refused to accept the suggestion that the sale was in fact effected for Rs. 1,10,000 as not being supported by any evidence but found that the reduction of the price by Rs. 5,000 from Rs. 1,10,000 for which the purchasers were ready and willing to buy the property, was made only for the purpose of depriving the appellant of his legitimate remu- neration of Rs. 6,000. He accordingly held that the appel- lant, who had performed his part of the contract by finding two persons who were ready, able and willing to buy at Rs. 1,10,000 was entitled to the commission claimed. The Division Bench (Harries C.J. and Mukherjea J.) which heard the appeal of the respondent, agreed with the trial Judge that the appellant's authority did not extend to the concluding of a binding contract for sale of the property, but differed from his view that all that the appellant was required to do was to introduce a purchaser who was ready and willing to buy for Rs. 1,10,000 and that he was entitled to his commission whether or not the property was sold at that price or at all. They held, following certain observa- tions of Lord Russell of Killowen and Lord Romer in the case next mentioned, that the appellant, having undertaken to ""negotiate the sale"" and to ""secure a buyer"", could not be said to have either secured a buyer or negotiated the sale ""unless the sale actually took place or at least a contract had been entered into "". As, however, a sale did take place between the persons in pro- duced by the plaintiff and the defendant, and as that sale, in the view also of the learned Judges, was the ""direct result of the plaintiff's negotiations"", they held that the appellant was entitled to commission but only on the price mentioned in the sale deed, namely,Rs. 1,05,000 which, they found was the price actually received by the respondent. As to why the respondent accepted a reduced price, Harries C.J., who delivered the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 4 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 judgment of the Court, observed: ""All that is known is that persons who undoubtedly made a firm offer of Rs. 1,10,000 for this property eventually bought it for Rs. 5,000 less. I strongly suspect that the price was reduced at the defendant's instance but I cannot find it as a fact "". In support of their view that the appellant was not entitled to any commision above that payable on a purchase price of Rs. 1,05,000 the learned Judges relied on the decision of the House of Lords in Luxor (Eastbourne) Ltd. v.Cooper (1), where it was held that, in a contract to pay commission upon the completion of the trans- action which the agent was asked to bring about, there was no room for implying a term that the principal shall not without just cause prevent the agent from earning his com- mission, and that it was open to the principal to break off negotiations and refuse to sell even after the agent had produced a customer who was ready and willing to purchase on the principal's terms. Applying what they conceived to be the principle of that decision, the Appellate Bench varied the decree of the trial Judge by reducing the amount payable to the appellant to a sum of Rs. 1,000. The commission letter runs as follows: ""I, Animendra Kissen Mitter of No. 20-B, Nilmoni Mitter Street, Calcutta, do hereby authorise you to negotiate the sale of my property, 27, Amratolla Street, free from all encumbrances at a price not less than Rs. 1,00,000. I shall make out a good title' to the property. If you succeed in securing a buyer for Rs. 1,00,000 I shall pay you Rs. 1,000 as your remuneration. If the price exceeds Rs. 1,05,000 and does not (1) [1941] A.C. 108. exceed Rs. 1,10,000 I shall pay you the whole of the excess over Rs. 1,05,000 in addition to your remuneration of Rs. 1,000 as stated above. In case you can secure a buyer at a price exceeding Rs. 1,10,000 I shall pay you twenty-five per cent. of the excess amount over Rs. 1,10,000 in addition to Rs. 6,000 as stated above. This authority will remain in force for one month from date"". In the absence of clear words expressing the intention of the parties it is possible to construe these terms in three different ways corresponding to the three patterns into which commission contracts with real estate brokers may broadly be said to fall. In the first place, the letter may be read as authorising the appellant not only to find a purchaser ready and willing to purchase the property at the price required but also to conclude a binding contract with him for the purchase and sale of the property on behalf of the respondent. Secondly, the contract may be construed as promising to reward the appellant for merely introducing a potential buyer who is ready, able and willing to buy at or above the price named, whether or not the deal goes through. And lastly, the commission note may be understood as requir- ing the appellant to find such a purchaser without authoris- ing him to conclude a binding contract of sale but making commission contingent upon the consummation of the transac- tion. As stated already, the first of these interpretations was rejected by the learned trial Judge as well as by the Appellate Bench, but it was pressed upon us by Mr. Setalvad on behalf of the appellant. We are unable to accept that view. The contract specifies only the price required by the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 5 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 respondent but does not furnish the broker with other terms such as those relating to the payment of the price, the investigation and approval of title, the execution of the conveyance, the parties who are to join in such conveyance, the costs incidental thereto and so on. In fact, the- agree- ment of sale dated the 9th June 1943 entered into by the respondent with the purchasers contains detailed stipula- tions on all these and other matters. Mr. Setalvad laid stress on the statement in the commission note that the sale was to be free from encumbrances and that a ""good title"" would be made out, but this is no more than a general indication of the nature of the bargain proposed and is perfectly consist- ent with an understanding that further details will be subject to negotiation between the respondent and the pur- chaser when found. As pointed out by Kekewich J. in Chadburn v. Moore(1) a house or estate agent is in a different position from a broker at the stock exchange owing to the peculiarities of the property with which he is to deal which does not pass by a short instrument as stocks and shares do but has to be transferred after investigation of title as to which various special stipulations, which might be of particular concern to the owner, may have to be inserted in a concluded con- tract relating to such property. The parties therefore do not ordinarily contemplate that the agent should have the authority to complete the transaction in such cases. That is why it has been held, both in England and here, that author- ity given to a broker to negotiate a sale and find a pur- chaser, without furnishing him with all the terms, means ""to find a man willing to become a purchaser and not to find him and make him a purchaser"": see Rosenbaum v. Belson(2) and Durga Charan Mitra v. Rajendra Narayan Sinha(3). Mr. Setalvad next suggested, in the alternative, that the second interpretation referred to above, which was favoured by the trial Judge, should be adopted, and that, inasmuchs, in that view also, the appellant had done all that he was required to do when he introduced to the re- spondent two prospective buyers who were ready and willing to buy the premises for Rs. 1,10,000, he was entitled to commission on that basis. Learned counsel criticised the view of the Appellate Bench, who adopted the third construc- tion, as illogical and inconsistent, and argued that, if authority to secure a buyer were to be taken to mean author- ity to find one who is not only ready and willing to buy but also becomes eventually a buyer in order to entitle the agent to his commission, then such authority must of neces- sity (1) 67 L.T. 257. (2) [1900] 2 Oh. 267. (8) 86 C.L.J. 467. extend to the concluding of a contract of sale, as otherwise the agent could not possibly accomplish the task assigned to him. We do not see much force in this criticism. As already indicated there are cogent reasons why an owner employing an estate agent to secure a purchaser should not, in the ab- sence of clear words to that effect, be taken to have autho- rised him to conclude a contract of sale, and we cannot see how the lack of such authority is inconsistent with an understanding that the agent is not to be entitled to his commission unless the owner and the purchaser introduced by the agent carried the transaction to completion. In the present case, however, it is not necessary to decide whether or not the commission note imports such an understanding, for a sale was in fact concluded with the purchasers introduced by the appellant who has thus, in any view, earned his commission, both the trial Judge and the Appellate Bench having found that the appellant's efforts were the effective cause of that sale. The only question is whether the commission is payable on the basis of Rs. 1,10,000 for which the appellant brought a firm offer from the purchasers, or on the basis of Rs. 1,05,000 which is the price mentioned in the conveyance. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 6 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 As already stated, the Appellate Bench based their decision on the ruling in the Luxor case. The learned Judges reasoned thus: ""In that case the principal had re- fused to sell in circumstances which afforded no reasonable excuse. Nevertheless, the House of Lords, reversing the Court of Appeal, held that no commission was payable. It appears to me that the principle is applicable to this case. Though the agent introduced a purchaser ready and willing to buy for Rs. 1,10,000 the sale for some reason took place at a lower figure. Even if the defendant unreasonably or without just cause refused to conclude the sale at the higher figure, nevertheless the plaintiff has no right to commission based on that higher figure "". We are unable to agree with this reasoning and conclusion. The ground of decision in the Luxor case was that, where commission was made payable on the completion of the transaction, the agent's right to commission was ""a purely contingent right"" and arose only when the purchase materia- lised. As Lord Simon put it ""The agent is promised a reward in return for an event and the event has not happened "". But the position is different where the principal, availing himself of the efforts of the agent, concludes the sale with the purchaser introduced by him, as the respondent did in the present case. As observed by Lord Russell of Killowen in the same case, ""where a contract is concluded with the purchaser, the event has happened upon the occurrence of which a right to the promised commission has become vested in the agent. From that moment no act or omission by the principal can deprive the agent of his vested right"". Apply- ing that principle, (even if the commission note in the present case were to be construed as making payment of commission conditional on the completion of the transaction, as it was in the English case) the appellant, having ""nego- tiated the sale"" and, secured buyers"" who made a firm offer to buy for Rs. 1,10,000 had done everything he was required by the respondent to do and acquired a right to the payment of commission on the basis of that price which he had suc- cessfully negotiated, subject only to the condition that the buyers should complete the transaction of purchase and sale. The condition was fulfilled when those buyers eventually purchased the property in question, and the appellant's right to commission on that basis became absolute and could not be affected by the circumstance that the respondent ""for some reason"" of his own sold the property at a lower price.' We accordingly hold that the appellant is entitled to the full commission of Rs. 6,000. The appeal is allowed, the decree passed on appeal in the Court below is set aside and that of the trial Judge restored. The appellant will have the costs of this appeal including the costs incurred in the lower court as well as his costs of the appeal in that court. MAHAJAN J.--This is an appeal by special leave from a judgment and decree of the High Court at Calcutta, dated 5th January 1948. By that judgment the High Court varied the judgment and decree of Gentle J. dated 11th June 1945 made in exercise of his original jurisdiction, decreeing the plaintiff's suit for recovery of a sum of Rs. 6,000. The appellant is a broker by profession residing at No. 81/1 Phear Lane, Calcutta, and carries on the business of a house agent. The respondent, Animendra Kissen Mitter, re- sides in No. 20B, Nilmony Mitter Street, Calcutta. The appellant was employed by the respondent to negoti- ate the sale of the respondent's premises, No. 27, Amratolla Street, Calcutta, on certain terms and conditions on commis- sion and the question raised by this appeal is whether the appellant is entitled to his commission under the circum- stances hereinafter mentioned. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 7 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 The facts are substantially admitted. By a letter dated 5th May, 1943, the appellant was employed by the respondent for arranging a sale of the premises above mentioned. This letter is in the following terms :-- ""I, Animendra Kissen Mitter of No. 20B, Nilmoni Mitter Street, Calcutta, do hereby authorize you to negotiate the sale of my above property free from all encumbrances at a price not less than Rs. 1,00,000. I shall make out a good title to the property. If you succeed in securing a buyer for Rs. 1,00,000 I shall pay you Rs. 1,000 as your remuner- ation. If the price exceeds Rs. 1,05,000 and does not exceed Rs. 1,10,000 I shall pay you the whole of the excess over Rs. 1,05,000 in addition to your remuneration of Rs. 1,000 as stated above. In case you can secure a buyer at a price exceeding Rs. 1,10,000. I shall pay you twenty-five per cent. of the excess amount over Rs. 1,10,000 in addition to Rs. 6,000 as stated above. This authority will remain in force for one month from date."" As recited in the letter, the authority given to the appellant was to remain in force for one month from 5th May 1943. Three days before the termination of the appellant's authority, on 2nd June 1943 the plaintiff appellant obtained an offer from two persons namely, Kishorilal Mahawar and Ramkumar Mahor, for the purchase of the premises regarding which the plaintiff had been author- ized to arrange a sale. This letter is in these terms :- ""We are willing to purchase the above house, land and premises at and for the price of Rs. 1,10,000 only free from all encumbrances. We hereby authorize you to accept the offer for sale of the above premises from Mr. A.K. Mitter for Rs. 1,10,000 on our behalf and send the confirmation to the vendor Mr. A.K. Mitter on our behalf."" On the same date the plaintiff gave a reply which runs thus :-- ""I am in receipt of your letter of date and under au- thority from the owner Mr. A.K. Mitter, I hereby confirm your offer for the purchase of the above premises at and for the price of Rs. 1,10,000 free from all encumbrances."" Simultaneously with the issue of this letter he gave intimation of this contract to the respondent in the follow- ing terms :-- ""Under the authority given to me by you I made an offer for the sale of the above premises to Messrs. Kishorilal Mahawar and Ram Kumar Mahor of No. 27, Amratolla Street, Calcutta, for rupees one lakh and ten thousand only and they have accepted the offer and they have authorized me to send a confirmation to you of the said offer. I accordingly confirm the offer made by you for the sale of the above premises for rupees one lakh and ten thousand only. The draft agreement for sale will be sent to you in the usual course. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 8 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 A copy of the letter of Messrs. Kishori Lal Mahawar and Ram Kumar Mahor accepting your offer is enclosed herewith."" The letter was received by Mitter on 3rd June 1943, two days before the termination of the plaintiff's authority. The respondent made no reply and kept silent. He did not question the agent's authority in effecting a binding con- tract of sale with the purchasers. He did not repudiate the transaction nor did he expressly ratify it. It was the plaintiff's case that he had accepted the purchasers' offer after getting express instructions from the respondent. That case, however, was not accepted in the two courts below. On 3rd June, 1943, the solicitor for the purchasers wrote to the solicitor for the agent that as the offer of his client for the purchase of 27, Amratolla Street had already been accepted and acceptance communicated to him, the title deeds should be sent so that a conveyance may be prepared. At his request inspection of the letter of au- thority was offered by the plaintiff and a copy of the letter was sent to him by post. On receipt of this copy the purchasers' solicitor assumed a curious attitude. He said that the copy of the letter sent contained different terms as to commission than those contained in 'the letter of authority originally shown to his client. The plaintiff was charged with making a secret illegal gain. In spite of these allegations it was asserted that the contract was a concluded one and that being so, the plaintiff was bound to refund to the purchasers whatever moneys he would receive from the vendor. It appears that the purchasers' attorney did not like the idea of the plaintiff pocketing a sum of Rs. 6,000 out of the purchase price, and this dislike on the part of the purchasers for the broker's commission has led to further complications resulting in this litigation. On 9th June, 1943, the purchasers' solicitor wrote to the plaintiff's solicitor that his client had cancelled the agreement of purchase. Immediately on receipt of this communication the plaintiff's solicitor replied expressing surprise at this attitude and accused the other party of a change of front with an ulterior motive. It was said that further instructions would be given after getting instruc- tions from Mitter to whom these letters were forwarded. It seems that the plaintiff was in the dark while writing the letter of 9th June, 1943, of the negotiations that were going on behind the scene directly between the purchasers and the vendor who had kept absolutely silent all this time. On 9th June the date of the alleged cancellation of the bargain already made, an agreement was executed between Animendra Kissen Mitter, the vendor, and Makkanlal, a benamidar of Kishorilal Mahawar and Ramkumar Mahor (the purchasers) for sale of the premises for a sum of Rs. 1,05,000. The sale deed in pursuance of this agreement was actually executed on 8th December, 1943, in favour of the original purchasers and not in favour of the benamidar. As pointed out by the learned Chief Justice who delivered the judgment of the appellate Bench, possibly some arrange- ment was made whereby both the defendant and the purchasers benefited by the insertion of a lower price in. the contract of sale and the transfer deed. It seems obvious enough that the defendant having received a firm offer of Rs. 1,10,000 for this property could not have parted with it for Rs. 5000 less except on the basis of some arrangement between himself and the purchasers under which both of them shared the commission instead of paying it to the broker. It was to the advantage of both of them. On 14th August, 1943, the appellant filed the suit out of which this appeal arises for recovery of Rs. 6,000, brokerage payable under the commission note. He also claimed relief by way of damages in the alternative. The defendant resisted the suit and denied the appellant's claim. Gentle J. who Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 9 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 heard the suit, gave judgment for the plaintiff and passed a decree for a sum of Rs. 6,000, with interest and costs in his favour. He held that on a true construction of the commission note the appellant's authority was to find a purchaser, namely, a man ready, able and willing to buy at a price acceptable to the respondent and that the appellant had accomplished this when he introduced to the respondent the purchasers and that he had done all that was required of him. It was held that the appellant had no authority to conclude a contract of sale and no binding contract of sale was made on 2nd and 3rd June, 1943, that the transaction effected nominally in the name of Makkanlal and completed on 8th December, 1943, in favour of Kishorilal Mahawar and Ramkumar Mahor, was effected solely through the intervention of the appellant who brought the parties together in the capacity at least of a potential buyer and seller, that the reduction of the price by Rs. 5000 from Rs. 1,10,000 was more than peculiar and that this reduction was made for one purpose and that was to deprive the plaintiff of his remuneration. The respondent preferred an appeal against this decree. This was partially allowed by the learned Chief Justice and Mukherjea J. on the following findings:that the appellant procured two persons, viz. Kishorilal Mahawar and Ram kumar Mahor, on 2nd June, 1943, who were willing to buy the property for Rs. 1,10,000, that on.a true construction of the contract of agency no commission was payable until at least a binding contract had been entered into between the appellant and the respondent, that the agent could only be said to have negotiated the sale if he introduced a person willing to buy who eventually bought, that the sale took place between the persons introduced by the appellant and the respondent and it was the direct result of the appel- lant's agency, that the commission note gave no authority to the appellant to conclude a contract of sale, that Makkanlal with whom the sale agreement dated 9th June was entered into was a benamidar of Kishorilal Mahawar and Ramkumar Mahor, that the appellant had no right to commission on a higher price than for which the sale was actually made and as the sale was actually made for Rs. 1,05,000, his remuneration could not exceed a sum larger than Rs. 1,000. On the basis of these findings the appeal was allowed and the decree granted by Gentle J. was modified and the plaintiff's suit was decreed in the sum of Rs. 1000. order for costs was made in the appeal. In this appeal Mr. Setalvad for the plaintiff raised three contentions: (1) That the finding of the court below that on a true construction of the commission note the plaintiff had no authority to make a binding contract re- garding the sale of this property with the purchasers was erroneous; (2) That even if that finding was correct, the plaintiff was entitled to a decree for the sum of Rs. 6,000, because he had done all that he had promised to do for the respondent, viz., he had secured a purchaser for Rs. 1,10,000, who was ready, able and will- ing to buy the property and that if by reason of his own caprice or in collusion with the purchasers, the respondent did not sell the property for Rs. 1,10,000 but chose to receive instead Rs. 1,05,0O0, the plaintiff could not be made to suffer. (3) That on the evidence it should have been held that the sale was made for a price of Rs. 1,10,000 and that the amount entered in the sale deed was fictitious. The first thing to see is what the parties have ex- pressed in the commission note and what is the true effect of the language employed in it, read in the light of the material facts. As pointed out by Viscount Simon, Lord Chancellor, in Luxor (Eastbourne), Ltd. v. Cooper (1), contracts with commission agents do not follow a single pattern and the primary necessity in each instance is to ascertain with precision -what are the express terms of the particular contract under discussion. I have very carefully Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 10 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 considered the terms of this contract in the light of the material circumstances and with great respect to the Judges who decided this case in the High Court, I am of the opinion that the authority given by the principal to the agent authorized him to enter into a binding contract to sale on his behalf. It was not a mere authority authorizing him to find a purchaser willing, able and ready to buy the premises for a price mentioned in the document. The note, to begin with, confers authority on the plaintiff to negotiate a sale free from all encumbrances at a price not less than Rs. 1,00,000. Then it proceeds to say that the principal under- takes to make out a good title to the property. It further provides that if the agent succeeds in securing a buyer for Rs. 1,00,000, he will be paid a sum of Rs. 1,000 as remuner- ation. In the concluding part of the note a scale of com- mission proportionate to the price has been promised in case a price higher than Rs. 1,00,000 was secured. In express words it is said that if the price exceeds Rs. 1,05,000 and does not exceed Rs. 1,10,000, (1) [1941] A .C . 108. ""I shall pay you the whole of the excess over Rs. 1,05,000 in addition to your remuneration of Rs. 1,000"", that if a buyer is secured at a price exceeding Rs. 1,10,000, he will be paid 25 per cent of the excess amount over Rs. 1,10,000 in addition to Rs. 6,000. The authority of the agent was to remain in force for one month. In my opinion, the terms of the note as regards the property being free from encum- brances and in respect of the guarantee about title indicate that the agent was given authority to make a binding con- tract. In a bare authority conferring power on a broker for introducing a customer, these stipulations would ordinarily find no place. The words ""to negotiate a sale"" standing by themselves may not authorize an agent to make a contract of sale. But here they do not stand by themselves. They are followed by two important conditions adverted to above. The agreement further lays down that if the broker succeeds in securing a buyer, he will get a certain remuneration. Gentle J. observed that the word ""securing"" here had the meaning of ""obtaining a buyer"". I have consulted the same dictionary as the learned Judge did and I find that the true meaning of the expression ""securing a buyer"" is ""to obtain a buyer firmly "". It is not possible in business sense to secure a buyer firmly unless he is bound by an offer and an acceptance. Otherwise, he is entitled to withdraw the offer at any time before acceptance and it cannot in this situa- tion be said that a buyer has been secured firmly. The word"" secure"" has not the same meaning as the word ""find"" or ""procure"". It gives an idea of safety and certainty. If a buyer is ensured, he is said to be secured and no buyer can be said to be ensured till he is bound by his offer and that cannot happen unless it stands accepted. The agent could only secure a buyer in the strict sense of the term if he had authority to enter into a binding contract. The word ""buyer"" when used in a strict sense also means ""a person who has actually made the purchase"" The authority given to an agent to secure a buyer therefore gives him authority to enter into a binding contract of sale with him. Without such an authority it was not possible to secure a buyer. I am further supported in this view by the language employed in the document in respect of the payment of the commission. When the price secured was Rs. 1,10,000, the broker was entitled to 25 per cent. of the excess. It is difficult to think of an excess in relation to price in a stipulation for commission unless the agent has been given an authority to make a contract of sale. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 11 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 If the scope of the authority is only to introduce a customer ready, able and willing to buy the property with an option to the principal to accept or to refuse the offer, then it would have been drawn up in a different language. The subsequent conduct of both the parties to the . agreement very strongly supports this view. The evidence of such conduct is relevant in this case because, as pointed out by Viscount Simon, L.C., in the case already referred to, the phrase ""finding a purchaser"" is itself not without ambiguity. Here the phrase is ""securing a purchaser "". This phrase similarly is not without ambiguity. The evi- dence of conduct of the parties in this situation as to how they understood the words to mean can be considered in determining the true effect of the contract made between the parties. Extrinsic evidence to determine the effect of an instrument is permissible where there remains a doubt as to its true meaning. Evidence of the acts done under it is a guide to the intention of the parties in such a case and particularly when acts are done shortly after the date of the instrument. (Vide para. 343 of Hailsham Edn. of Hals- bury, Vol. 10, p. 274). So far as the conduct of the agent is concerned, he accepted the offer and under his own signature sent the letter of acceptance to the purchasers. In the letter writ- ten by him to his principal he specifically refers to his authority. The correspondence above mentioned clearly shows that both the purchasers and the agent thought that a concluded contract had been made. Information of this was given to the vendor and though he did not speak, his silence in the circumstances of the case seems as eloquent as speech would have been. He never repudiated the contract made by the agent but behind his back entered into a fresh contract with the same persons who had been secured by the agent in a surrep- titious manner. In the witness box he assumed a dishonest and untruthful attitude. The learned trial Judge pronounced him a liar and rightly too. He asserted complete ignorance about the subsequent contract of sale and fixed all blame on to his son When asked about the sale price on the contract of 9th June, 1943, his answer was that he knew nothing about this and said that because his son asked him to sign the deed he did sign it and that was all that he knew. When faced with the sale deed, he said that he did not know what his son had told him as to what was written in the deed. He added that he did not know what consideration was paid to him for the sale. He further professed not to know whether the sale price went into his banking account or was even entered in the account books. After a great deal of prevari- cation he was made to accept the document of 5th May, 1948, and its terms. He admitted that on 3rd June he had a conver- sation with the purchasers and was informed by them that they had entered into a bargain with the broker and that the broker had deceived them about the commission and therefore they would not buy the house. He admitted that he got the letter sent by the plaintiff, but gave no explanation as to why he sent no reply to that letter. With great difficulty he was made to accept his signature on the postal acknowl- edgment about the receipt of the letter sent by the broker to him informing him of the concluded bargain made with the purchasers, and he had to admit that he got that letter from the broker. He also admitted that he took no objection to the letter written by the broker before Kishoribabu had told him the story about the commission of two per cent. In further cross-examination he admitted that what was stated by the broker in the letter of the 2nd June was correct. The whole evidence given by the defendant consists of eva- sive statements and his ultimate resort was in lapses of memory. It is quite clear from his deposition that the respondent accepted the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 12 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 contract made by the agent and was clearly under the belief that the agent had not exceeded his authority in entering into a binding contract with the purchasers. I am therefore of the opinion that the authority given to the agent in this case was an authority to enter into a binding contract of sale and this he did and he was therefore enti- tled to his commission of Rs. 6,000. The learned single Judge and the learned Judges of the Court of Appeal found otherwise on this part of the case in view of certain decisions of English Courts and a decision of a Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court. In my opinion, none of those cases touch the present case. Unless the language of two documents is identical, an interpreta- tion placed on one document is no authority for the proposi- tion that a document differently drafted, though using partially similar language, should be similarly interpreted. In Hamer v. Sharp(1) Sir Charles Hall, V.C., considered the case of an authority of an agent for sale appointed by the owner of an estate. The document in that case was in these terms :-- ""I request you to procure a purchaser for the following freehold property, and to insert particulars of the same in your Monthly Estate Circular till further notice, viz., my beer house and shop No. 4 and No. 6 Manchester Road, Tenant No. 4, William Galloway, gilder, and No. 6, Albert Vaults, Henry Holmes, beer retailer, and work rooms above. Present net rent, pound 150, price pound 2800, when I will pay you a commission and expenses of fifty pounds. About six years' lease unexpired."" The Vice-Chancellor observed as follows :-- ""The question is whether, when an owner of an estate puts it into the hands of an estate agent for sale, stating a price for and giving particulars of the property to enable him to inform intending purchasers, but giving no instruc- tions as to the absolute disposal, and none as to the title of the property, and mentioning none of those special stipu- lations which it might be proper to insert in conditions in reference to the title, (1) L.R. 19 Eq. 108, that is sufficient authority to the agent to sign a contract for the sale of the property for the price stated in the instructions, without making any provision whatsoever as to title. In considering whether the instructions of October, 1872, were a sufficient authority to the agent for that purpose, I cannot help expressing an opinion that such an authority to an agent on the part of a vendor would be highly imprudent, as the purchaser would then be entitled to require, on completion, attested copies of all documents of title, and the expense of them would swallow up, to a great extent, the purchase money. This estate agent must have known that if this property had been offered for sale by public auction there would have been conditions to guard the vendor against being subject to certain expenses, and to prevent the contract becoming abortive by reason of a pur- chaser requiring a strictly marketable title. Could he suppose that he was invested with authority to sign a con- tract without considering what it should contain as regards title ? As an intelligent and well informed person, he could not suppose that he was properly discharging his duty to his Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 13 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 principal when he signed the contract which he signed; such a contract was not one within the scope of his authority to sign."" The case therefore stood decided on the construction of the document. It was remarked that in those circumstances it was not necessary to decide what words would confer such an authority. Having said so, the learned Vice-Chancellor proceeded to observe as follows :-- ""but I nevertheless state my opinion to be, that when instructions are given to an agent to find a purchaser of landed property, he, not being instructed as to the condi- tions to be inserted in the contract as to title, is not authorized to sign a contract on the part of the vendor. This case can hardly be said to be an authority for the construction of the agreement that we are called upon to construe in the present case. Considerable emphasis was laid in that case on the point that no instructions had been given as to the conditions that had to be inserted in the agreement as to title. In the present case the agent was told that the principal guaranteed marketable title. He was further told that the sale should be free of encumbrances. All the material conditions of sale were thus contained in the present agreement. The next case on which considerable reliance was placed in the courts below is the case of Chadburn v. Moore (1). In this case an advertisement appeared in the Daily Tele- graph in these words :-- ""Forced sale by order of the mortgagees--thirty four well built houses, situated at Grays, close to the station on the London, Tilbury, and Southend Railway, within easy reach of the docks, all let to respectable tenants at rents amounting to pound 620 per annum. Held for about ninety-five years at ground rents amounting to pound 146; price pound 3500, of which pound 3000 can remain on mortgage. For further particulars apply to Messrs. Pinder, Simpson and Newman, 33 and 34, Savilerow, London, W."" In response to this advertisement the plaintiff in that case, James Chadburn, called on Messrs. Pinder, Simpson and Newman, a firm of surveyors and estate agents, for further information. He then went to see the houses and came back and made an offer to purchase them, which was reduced to writing. It appeared from the evidence that the offer was to be submitted by Mr. Newman to his client the defendant, and the plaintiff was to return the next day for an answer. Newman saw the defendant, who gave him instructions to withdraw five of the houses, and fixed the price, but did not, according to the evidence given in court, give instruc- tions to Newman to enter into a binding contract. Later on the plaintiff called on Messrs. Pinder, Simpson and Newman and two letters were exchanged between them, which were letters of offer and acceptance for the twenty-nine houses at Grays. The offer and acceptance were forwarded by the defendant to the estate agents. The defendant on receiving this offer wrote a letter saying inter alia:- (1) 67 L.T. 257 ""I think you were, as you usually are, a little prema- Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 14 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 ture in actually entering into what might be a binding contract. It is always best to have an offer and acceptance subject to a formal contract being entered into... "" To this Newman replied:- ""The offer for the above was accepted under your definite instructions and is a very good get out for you."" Kekewich J., who decided this case, gave the following judgment :-- ""Having heard Mr. Newman, who was called without the plaintiff knowing what he was going to say, and having read the correspondence, I have little doubt that I have the real transaction--which is a mere transaction between prin- cipal and agent--before me. It might be' that a different colour would be put upon the matter by the cross-examination of Mr. Moore, but this was not done, and he is entitled to have judgment upon the point of law. Moore undoubtedly authorized Newman to find a purchaser for the houses. It is true the expression does not come out on the correspondence. On the second occasion Newman appears to have been instruct- ed to negotiate a sale. Whatever else he did do, Moore did not in express. terms authorize Newman to enter into a contract.Newman was to find a purchaser, and to negotiate a sale. Is that sufficient ? No evidence was given as to custom; no evidence was brought to show that the position of a house or estate agent resembles that of a broker on the Stock Exchange or any other exchange. A house or estate agent is in a different position, owing to the peculiarity of the property with which he has to deal, which does not pass by a short instrument as stocks and shares do, but has to be transferred after investigation of title and in ac- cordance with strict laws. An agent fox sale of real estate must be more formally constituted than a seller of stocks and securities of a similar nature. There is no definite authority; in Hamer v. Sharp (1), Hall, V.C., does not (1) 19 Eq. 108. go so far as to say an estate agent cannot enter into any contract, and does not decide the question of authority, but only states his opinion. I must perforce refer to Prior v. Moore (1), where I indicated my own opinion distinctly, that instruction to a house agent to procure a purchaser and to negotiate a sale does not amount to authority to the agent to bind his principal by contract. Here the circumstance must not be forgotten that Moore on the second occasion told Newman what he was prepared to take for the twenty-nine houses. Newman then jumped at the conclusion that he had power at that price to enter into a contract. That is in my opinion not sufficient, and unless express authority is given to the agent to sell, and for that purpose to enter into a binding contract, the principal reserves his final right to accept or refuse. "" In this case there was no written document between the principal and the agent. From the correspondence it was inferred that the principal had asked the agent to find a purchaser or to negotiate a sale and it was held that within these words an authority to sell could not be spelt out. Not only is the language of the document with Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 15 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 which we are concerned different, but the evidence in the case particu- larly about the conduct of the parties is materially differ- ent. The observations made by the learned Judge must be taken to be limited to the facts found by him. The expres- sions ""find a purchaser"" ""procure a purchaser"" ""negotiate a sale"" standing by themselves may not 'be sufficient to confer authority on the agent to enter into a binding con- tract on behalf of the principal; but as I have indicated above, the words in the present case are such as by neces- sary implication conferred authority on the agent for making a binding contract. The next case is Durga Charan Mitra v. Rajendra Narain Sinha (2), a Bench decision of the Calcutta High Court. The document considered in that case bears considerable resem- blance with the document in the present case. (1) 3 T.L.R.624. (2) 36 C.L.J.467. It was in these terms :-- ""I hereby authorize you to negotiate the sale of the lands at Tolligunge I have recently purchased from Messrs Martin and Co. If you can secure a purchaser to purchase the same at the gross value of Rs. 16,000, I shall pay you Rs. 200 as your remuneration. If you be able to raise the price to any amount above Rs. 16,000, you will be entitled to the excess amount fully and I shall be bound to mention the whole amount in the conveyance. Please note that this letter of authority will remain in force for a fortnight only to complete the transaction; after that this letter will stand cancelled."" The agent acting on this authority sold the property. On receipt of this letter the vendor informed the agent that he would not sell the land. On the acceptance of the agent a suit was brought for specific performance. Sir Asutosh Mookerjee who delivered the judgment of the Bench referred to the cases of Hamer v. Sharp (1), Prior v. Moore (2), Chadburn v. Moore (3), and also Rosenbaum v. Belson (4), and observed that it was well settled that an estate or house- agent, authorized to procure a purchaser, has no implied authority to enter into an open contract of sale, because the transaction mentioned is as specified in the letter, viz., to negotiate a sale after securing a purchaser. There is similarity in the language employed in the letter dealt with in this case and the letter of authority with which we are concerned; but read as a whole, the two documents are drafted with 'different intents and the true effect of both is not the same. There was no mention of the title being guaranteed by the vendor or of the sale being made free of encumbrances in that case. There was no evidence of sur- rounding circumstances or of the conduct of the parties. On the other hand, the plaintiff who was himself a solicitor realized the difficulties of the situation and endeavoured to alter the foundation of his claim. He conceded that as a broker he had no authority to sell the property and that he (1) 19 Eq. 108. (8) 67 L.T. 257, (2) 3 T.L.R. 624 (4) (1900) 2 Ch. 267. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 16 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 could not have taken a conveyance of sale of the plot. In the present case the attitude adopted by the parties, as already pointed out, was entirely different. Sir Asutosh Mookerjee also cited the case of Rosenbaum v. Belson (1). In this case the learned Judge made the following observa- tions:- "" To my mind there is a substantial difference between those expressions. Authorizing a man to sell means an authority to conclude a sale; authorizing him to find a purchaser means less than that--it means to find a man willing to become a purchaser, not to find him and also make him a purchaser."" In Saunders v. Dence (2), Field J. distinguished Hamer v. Sharp(s), saying that 'all that Hall, V.C.,in that case decided, as I understand it, was that if you go to an estate agent, and tell him you have a property to sell, and that you want a purchaser, and you tell him what you have made up your mind shall be the price, and to a certain extent what shall be the conditions, and you instruct him to try and find a purchaser, that is not sufficient, under those cir- cumstances, to authorize the agent to make a contract with- out any conditions whatever with regard to the title'. I have been unable to find any case in which it has been held that instructions given by A.B. to sell for him his house, and an agreement to pay so much on the purchase price accepted, are not an authority. to make a binding contract, including an authority to sign an agreement. In my opinion, on the terms of the instrument in this case and in view of the relevant evidence the correct con- clusion to draw is that the agent had authority to enter into a binding contract with the purchaser and that he did and is therefore entitled to succeed in the case. Reference in this connection may be made to Wragg v. Lovett (4), where Lord Greene, M.R., put the proposition in these words :-- ""Whether or not the agents were authorized (or, what in law is the same thing, reasonably understood (1) (1900) 2 Ch. 267. (3) 19 Eq. 108. (2) 52 L.T. 644. (4) [1948] 2 A.E.R. 969. themselves to be authorized) to make this particular con- tract"", and it was held that the proper inference from all the facts of the case was that the defendant was satisfied to allow his agents to make whatever contract they thought best and relied on them to protect his interests provided, and provided only, that they obtained the desired statement from the plaintiff as to his intention to remain in the house. The answer to the question depends on the facts of each individual case and though authority to make a binding contract has not to be lightly inferred from vague or ambig- uous language but from substantial grounds, that however does not mean that in express words it should be stated that the agent is authorized to sell the property. The learned Chief Justice in the judgment under appeal observed that ""the agent had undertaken to negotiate a sale and secure a buyer. He could not be said to have either secured a buyer or negotiated a sale unless a sale actually took place or at least a contract of sale had been entered into"". If that is the correct construction of the note, then in my judgment, the true implication of the note is that the agent was authorized to enter into a binding con- tract, because otherwise he could not have secured a buyer. Later on, the learned Chief Justice while referring to the case of Rosenbaum v. Belson(1), took the view that authoriz- ing a man to sell meant an authority to conclude a sale and authorizing a man to find a purchaser meant less than that. It meant finding a man willing to become a purchaser, not to find Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 17 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 him and also make him a purchaser. If that was the duty entrusted to the agent, then he had clearly per- formed his duty and was entitled to his commission. For the reasons given above I am of the opinion that the plaintiff had authority to enter into a binding contract on behalf of the defendant and he entered into such a contract and thereby earned the commission which he has claimed in the suit and he is entitled to a (1) [1900] 2 Ch. 267. decree in the sum of Rs. 6,000 which the trial Judge had given to him, with all costs throughout. Conceding for the sake of argument that the construction that I have placed on the agreement entered into between the principal and the agent is not the correct one, the question arises .whether in that event the decision under appeal can be maintained. I am inclined to the opinion that even on the construction placed by the trial Judge on the commission note the view taken by him was the correct one and the court of appeal arrived at a wrong conclusion by giving too much importance to certain obiter observations of Lord Russell of Killowen and Lord Romer in Luxor (Eastbourne) Ltd. v. Coop- er(1). In this very case it was pointed out by Viscount Simon L.C. that there were at least three different classes of cases in which the question of a right to commission could arise. He states the first of them in these terms :-- ""There is the class in which the agent is promised a commission by his principal if he succeeds in introducing to his principal a person who makes an adequate offer, usually an offer of not less than the stipulated amount. If that is all that is needed in order to earn his reward, it is obvi- ous that he is entitled to be paid when this has been done, whether this principal accepts the offer and carries through the bargain or not. No implied term is needed to secure this result."" In my opinion, the present case falls within this class of case and commission became payable on the introduction of a willing buyer by the agent to the principal. In Burcheil v. Cowrie & Blockhouse Collieries Ltd.(2) it was observed by their Lordships of the Privy Council that if an agent brings a person into relation with his principal as an intending purchaser, the agent has done the most effec- tive, and, possibly, the most laborious and expensive, part of his work, and that if the principal takes advantage of that work, and, behind the back of the agent and unknown to him, sells to the purchaser thus brought into touch with him on terms (1) [1941] A.C. 108. (2) [1910] A.C. 614. which the agent theretofore advised the principal not to accept, the agent's act may still well be the effective cause of the sale and that there can be no real difference between such a case and those cases where the principal sells to the purchaser introduced by the agent at a price below the limit given to the agent. In Inchbald v. Western Neilgherry Coffee etc. Co. (1) Willes J. thus lays down the rule of law applicable to such cases :-- ""I apprehend that wherever money is to be paid by one man to another upon a given event, the party upon whom is cast the obligation to pay, is liable to the party who is to receive the money if he does any act which prevents or makes it less probable that Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 18 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 he should receive it."" The rule has been stated by Story on Agency at page 404 in the following terms :-- ""The general rule of law, as to commissions, undoubtedly is, that the whole service or duty must be performed, before the right to any commissions attaches, either ordinary or extraordinary; for an agent must complete the thing required of him, before he is entitled to charge for it. In the case of brokers employed to sell real estate, it is well settled that they are entitled to their commission when they have found a purchaser, even though the negotiations are conduct- ed and concluded by the principal himself; and also where there is a failure to complete the sale in consequence of a defect in title and no fault on the part of the brokers."" In my judgment therefore, Gentle J. was right when he held on the interpretation placed by him on the document that the plaintiff had earned his commission in full inas- much as he had secured a buyer who was ready, able and willing to buy the property for Rs. 1,10,000. As I have indicated above, if the word ""buyer"" is to be construed in a strict sense, then it must be held that the broker had authority to secure a buyer of that type and he could only do so by making a binding (1) 17 C.B. (N.S.) 733. contract with him. On the other hand, if the word is taken to mean a potential buyer, such a buyer having been secured, the agent was entitled to the commission that had been promised to him. It is now convenient to consider the case of Luxor (Eastbourne) Ltd. v. Cooper(1) in some detail because cer- tain observations made by Lord Russell of Killowen and Lord Romer are the basis of the decision of the learned Chief Justice. In this case no commission note was addressed to the broker and the contract was not contained in any docu- ment. Evidence in support of the commission agreement was oral and its terms had to be deduced from that evidence. Viscount Simon L.C., out of the materials from which express contract had to be pieced together, reached the result that the bargain was this: ""If a party introduced by the respondent should buy the cinemas for at least pound 1,85,000, each of the two appel- lants would pay to the respondent pound 5,000 on the comple- tion of the sale."" No such sale took place, and in those circumstances it was held that there could be nothing due to the respondent on the terms of the express bargain. It was then argued that since the proposed purchasers introduced by the re- spondent were and remained willing and able to buy the properties for the minimum price, while the appellants did not close with the offer, the appellants were liable in. damages to the respondent for breach of an implied term of the commission contract. In the statement of claim the implied term was said to be that the appellants would"" do nothing to prevent the satisfactory completion of the trans- action so as to deprive the respondent of the agreed commis- sion."" The breach pleaded was the failure to complete the contract of sale with the respondent's client and the dis- posal of the subject-matter in another quarter. The Lord Chancellor Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 19 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 was of the opinion that the suggested implied term was not necessary in this contract and it was observed that in contracts made with commission agents there was no justification for introducing an implied term unless it was necessary to (1) [1941] A.C. 108. do so for the purpose of giving to the contract the business effect which both parties to it intended it should have. Lord Russell of Killowen in his opinion said that the only right of the plaintiff was to receive his commission out of the purchase moneys if and when received. His right was a purely contingent right. He stood .to earn a very large sum at comparatively small pains, taking the risk of either side withdrawing from the negotiations before any binding contract of sale and purchase was concluded, or of the contract for any reason not being carried to completion. In this view of the case the action was bound to fail and no occasion arose for pronouncing on the correctness or other- wise of the view expressed by the Court of Appeal in Trol- lope & Sons v. Martyn Brothers (1). Then it was said that as the question of these commission contracts was discussed at great length, that furnished an excuse for stating brief- ly conclusions which his Lordship's mind, free as it was from the fetter of previous decisions, reached. In dealing with the subject the following observations were made :-- ""I can find no safe ground on which to base the intro- duction of any such implied term. Implied terms, as we all know, can only be justified under the compulsion of some necessity. No such compulsion or necessity exists in the case under consideration. The agent is promised a commission if he introduces a purchaser at a specified or minimum price. The owner is desirous of selling. The chances are largely in favour of the deal going through, if a purchaser is introduced. The agent takes the risk in the hope of a substantial remuneration for comparatively small exertion. In the case of the plaintiff his contract was made on Sep- tember 23, 1935; his client's offer was made on October 2, 1935. A sum of I0,000 (the equivalent of the remuneration of a year's work by a Lord Chancellor) for work done within a period of eight or nine days is no mean reward, and is one well worth a risk. There is no lack of business efficacy..in sUCh a contract, I even (1) [1934] 2 K.B. 436. though the principal is free to refuse to sell to the agent's client. The position will no doubt be different if the matter has proceeded to the stage of a binding contract having been made between the principal and the agent's client. In that case it can be said with truth that a 'purchaser' has been introduced by the agent; in other words, the event has happened upon the occurrence of which a right to the prom- ised commission has become vested in the agent. From that moment no act or omission by the principal can deprive the agent of that vested right."" It is the observations last quoted which are the basis of the decision of the learned Chief Justice in the present case. It seems to me that these observations had reference to cases visualized by Lord Russell of Killowen in the earlier part of this quotation with specific reference to the facts found in that case and cannot apply to all cases where the word ' purchaser ' or 'buyer' has been loosely used in a different context. Lord Romer in his opinion made the following observa- tions :- Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 20 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 ""But supposing that a contract by one person to pay another a sum of money in the event of the latter performing an unsolicited service to the former is as much subject to an implied condition as if the latter had been employed to perform the service, the condition is in general one that merely imposes on the former a negative and not a positive obligation. If I employ a man for reward to build a house on my land I subject myself to an implied condition that I will do nothing to prevent him carrying out the work. But I am under no implied obligation to help him earn the reward whether by the supply of building materials or otherwise. But there are exceptional cases where in a contract of employment the employer is under a positive obligation. If, for instance, I employ an artist to paint my portrait I subject myself to the positive obligation of giving him the requisite sittings. The question, then, to be determined upon the hypothesis that I mentioned just now is this: Where an owner of property employs an agent to find a purchaser, which must mean at least a person who enters into a binding contract to purchase, is it an implied term of the contract of agency that, after the agent has introduced a person who is ready, willing and able to purchase at a price assented to by the principal, the principal shall enter into a contract with that person to sell at the agreed price subject only to the qualification that he may refuse to do so if he has just cause or reasonable excuse for his refusal ? This qualifica- tion must plainly be added, for the respondent does not contend, and no one could successfully contend, that the obligation of the principal to enter into a contract is an unconditional one."" The learned Chief Justice relying on the last part of the above quotation reached the conclusion that in the present case as the duty of the agent was to secure a pur- chaser, it could not be held that the purchaser had been secured till the contract of sale was concluded by the vendor with him and that the actual sale having been con- cluded for a sum of Rs. 1,05,000, the plaintiff could only get his remuneration on the basis of the price for which the sale was made and not on the basis of the offer the plain- tiff had secured. It seems to me that when Lord Romer was laying down that a purchaser in such contracts means at least a person who enters into a binding contract to pur- chase, he had in mind the contract with which he was dealing in that case. I am free to think that Lord Romer had not in mind commission notes wherein the word ""buyer"" or ""purchas- er"" had been employed in a loose sense. In Jones v. Lowe(1), wherein the instrument was in these terms-- ""In the event of my introducing a purchaser, I shall look to you for the payment of the usual commission in accordance with the scale fixed by the Auctioneers and Estate Agents Institute "", Hilbery J. said that had he been free of authority, he should have thought that there were strong grounds for saying that what every owner of a house who desired to (1) [1945] 1 K.B. 73. sell it expected a house agent to do, was to bring the property fairly to the notice of persons who resorted to him for houses and endeavour to persuade one of them to buy it. The learned Judge further observed as follows :-- Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 21 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 ""If the agent introduces someone who is perfectly will- ing to go through with the purchase at a price which will satisfy the vendor, it would seem that the agent has done everything that the parties contemplate that he should do, for they do not contemplate that the agent should have anything to do with the actual completion of the transac- tion. He is to find a person who will pay the price which is asked for the property, and the contract is entered into on the basis that the person so found will be the person to whom the owner of the property will sell. It seems to me hard, if an agent has done to the full extent what the parties contemplated that he should do, that he should not be entitled to say ' I have done what I con- tracted to do because I have introduced someone willing to purchase although he never in fact became the. actual pur- chaser'. I do not feel, however, that it is open to me to put that construction on the words of the contract in the present case because I think that the observations made in the House of Lords, and particularly those of Lord Russell of Killowen and Lord Romer in Luxor (Eastbourne) Ltd. v. Cooper (1), show that they were clearly of opinion that if an agent is employed to introduce a purchaser for a house and before the purchaser has entered into a binding and legal contract, the house is withdrawn from the market, the agent cannot say that he has earned his commission."" In a later case, E.H. Bennett v. Millet (2), the same learned Judge had to deal with a case where the contract was in these terms :-- ""We confirm that in the event of our introducing a purchaser who is able and willing to complete the transac- tion, our commission will be in accordance with the recog- nized scale..."". The plaintiffs introduced a prospective purchaser, Whom the court found to have been at all times able (1) [1941] A.C. 108. (2) (1948) 2 All. E.R. 929. and willing to purchase, but the defendant refused to com- plete. It was argued by the defendant that the qualifica- tion of the word ""purchaser"" in the plaintiffs' letter was otiose and therefore should be struck out and the plaintiffs had not performed the contract until they had introduced a person who actually. completed the purchase. It was held that the expression ""a purchaser who is able and willing to complete the transaction"" meant not a person who did, in fact, ultimately purchase the property, but one who was prepared to purchase it at the seller's price, and, as the estate agents had found such a person, they were entitled to their commission. The learned Judge further stated that in ordinary parlance we do not use the word ""purchaser"" as necessarily restricted to a person who actually completes a transaction of purchase and sale. In my judgment, there- fore, on the alternative interpretation which has been placed by the two courts below on the commission note the word ""purchaser"" cannot be read in the strict sense in which it was read in Luxor's case (1), but should be read in the sense in which it is loosely used in common parlance, and that being so, the decision under appeal cannot be sus- tained. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 22 Abdulla Ahmed vs Animendra Kissen Mitter on 14 March, 1950 Mr. Setalvad cited a number of Indian authorities where the words ""buyer"" and ""purchaser"" had not been given the strict meaning that had been given in Luxor's case (1). Similarly, the words ""lender"" and ""borrower"" had been given the meaning of ""potential lender"" and ""potential borrower"". It is, however, unnecessary to enter into a discussion of all those cases as it does not in any way advance the matter beyond what I have already said. It is unnecessary to go into the third contention of Mr. Setalvad in view of the above decision. For the reasons given above I agree with the conclusion reached by my brother, Patanjali Sastri, in the judgment just delivered by him, that the appeal be allowed with costs throughout. Appeal allowed. Agent for the appellant: S.P. Varma. Agent for the respondent: Sukumar Ghose. (1) [1941] A.C. 108. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1780900/ 23"

The appellants herein, namely, Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar(A-1), Alagond Sahebagouda Rudragoudar(A-2) and Mudakappa @ Gadegappa Rudragoudar(A-3) along with Sahebagouda Gadageppa Rudragoudar(A-4), Basappa Avvanna @ Huvanna Giradi @ Chigari (A-5) and Basappa Dundappa @ Dondiba Hanjagi (A-6) were subjected to trial in Sessions Case No. 28 of 2002 in the Court of the learned Fast Track Court I, Bijapur for charges pertaining to offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 506(2) and Section 302 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter being referred to as ‘IPC’). 2. For the sake of convenience, the appellants shall hereinafter be referred to as A-1, A-2 and A-3. 3. The learned trial Court proceeded to discard the prosecution story and acquitted the accused appellants(A-1, A-2 and A-3) along with A-4, A-5 and A-6 vide judgment dated 23rd July, 2005. 4. The State of Karnataka challenged the said judgment recording acquittal of A-1 to A-6 by filing Criminal Appeal No. 2215/2005 before the High Court of Karnataka. The Division Bench of High Court vide its judgment dated 14th September, 2009 proceeded to allow the appeal; reversed the acquittal of A-1, A-2 and A-3 and convicted these accused for the offence punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC and sentenced them to undergo imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs. 50,000/- each within a period of six months and in default, to further undergo imprisonment Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166574806/ 1 Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 April, 2024 for two years. The appeal as against A-5 and A-6 was dismissed, while appeal qua A-4 stood abated on account of his death. Out of the fine amount to be realised, a sum of Rs. 10,000/- was ordered to be paid to the State Government and the balance amount of Rs. 1,40,000/- was ordered to be paid to the complainant(PW-1). 5. The judgment dated 14th September, 2009 rendered by the learned Division Bench of the High Court reversing the acquittal of the accused appellants and convicting and sentencing them as above is assailed in the present appeal. Brief facts: - 6. The complainant, Chanagouda(PW-1) owns agricultural lands and a house in village Babanagar, Bijapur, Karnataka. It is alleged by the prosecution that in the morning of 19th September, 2001, the deceased Malagounda, son of complainant, along with labourers/servants Revappa(PW-2), Siddappa(PW-3), Hiragappa(PW-4) and Suresh(PW-5) had gone to put up a bund (check dam) in their land. At about 12 o’ clock in the afternoon, the complainant(PW-1) packed lunch for these five persons and proceeded to the field where the farming operations were being undertaken. The work continued till 3.30 p.m. and thereafter, the four servants(PW-2, PW-3, PW-4 and PW-5), along with the deceased Malagounda and the complainant(PW-1) proceeded to the village. They had reached near the land of one Ummakka Kulkarni at about 4.00 pm, where A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4 suddenly came around and exhorted that the way the complainant party had murdered Sangound, they would take revenge upon the members of the complainant party in the same manner. A-1 holding a jambai, A-2 holding an axe, A-3 holding a sickle and A-4 holding an axe, belaboured Malagounda, as a result of which he fell down. The assailants thereafter threatened the complainant(PW-1) that if he tried to intervene, he too would meet the same fate as his son. Fearing for his own life, the complainant(PW-1) ran away and hid behind the bushes in order to avoid being beaten by the accused. 7. After sunset, the complainant(PW-1) returned to the village and narrated about the incident to his family members. A written complaint of this incident came to be submitted by the complainant(PW-1) at Tikota Police Station on 20th September, 2001 at 4.00 am in the morning whereupon FIR(Exhibit P-10) was registered and investigation commenced. After conclusion of investigation, a charge sheet came to be filed against the appellants(A-1, A-2, A-3) and other accused(A-4, A-5 and A-6) for the offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 148, 506(2) and Section 302 read with Section 149 IPC in the Court of jurisdictional Magistrate. The case being exclusively sessions triable was committed to the Court of Sessions Judge, Bijapur where charges were framed against the accused for the above offences. The accused persons pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The prosecution examined as many as 27 witnesses, exhibited 24 documents and 17 material objects to prove its case. The accused, upon being questioned under Section 313 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973(hereinafter being referred to as ‘CrPC’) claimed that they were innocent and had been falsely implicated in the case. However, no evidence was led in defence. For the sake of convenience, the details of the prosecution witnesses are enlisted below: - Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166574806/ 2 Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 April, 2024 PW-1 Chanagouda (complainant)(eye witness) PW-2 Revappa (eye witness) PW-3 Siddappa (eye witness) (hostile) PW-4 Hiragappa (eye witness) PW-5 Suresh (eye witness) (hostile) PW-6 Basagonda (eye witness) PW-7 Appasaheb (last seen witness) PW-8 Sabu (panch witness) PW-9 Basu (panch witness) PW-10 Ramu (panch witness) PW-11 Bhimanna (panch witness) PW-12 Sangond (panch witness) PW-13 Shantinath (panch witness) PW-14 Sakrubai (mother of the deceased) (hearsay witness) PW-15 Shankargouda (eye witness) PW-16 Siddappa (hearsay witness) PW-17 Dr. Anilkumar (Medical Jurist) PW-18 Shetteppa (Retd. ASI) (registered the FIR) (Poujadar) PW-19 Veerbhadrayya (Carrier Constable) PW-20 Dayanand (Photographer) PW-21 Raju (Scribe of Sketch Map) PW-22 Shrishail (Carrier Constable) PW-23 Ratansing (Assistant Sub-Inspector) PW-24 Chandrashekhar (Investigating Officer) PW-25 Jaganath (PSI) PW-26 Mohammadsharif (Assistant Sub-Inspector) PW-27 Basanagouda (Police Inspector, State Intelligence, Bangalore) (2nd Investigating Officer) 8. Upon hearing the arguments advanced by the prosecution and the defence counsel and after thoroughly appreciating the evidence available on record, the trial Court proceeded to hold that the prosecution could not prove the charges levelled against the accused beyond all manner of doubt and acquitted all the six accused vide judgment dated 23rd July, 2005 with the following pertinent findings: - (i) That in the charge sheet, the prosecution had involved A-5 and A-6. However, none of the witnesses examined by the prosecution spoke a single word incriminating A-5 and A-6 either individually or vicariously and this circumstance casted serious doubts in the mind of the Court with regard to the conduct of the witnesses to implicate A-1 to A-4 while exonerating A-5 and A-6. (ii) That PW-1, PW-2, PW-3, PW-4, PW-5 and PW-6 gave contradictory versions regarding exact identities/names of the assailants. (iii) PW-4 who was a coolie and had worked along with the deceased Malagounda did not implicate A-4 in the crime. (iv) Basagonda(PW-6), projected to be an eye witness gave evidence contradicting the evidence of PW-2 and PW-4. (v) Rudrappa, son of PW-6 was one of the accused in the murder of Sangound, son of A-4 and thus, the said witness had a motive to speak against A-1 to A-4. (vi) Likewise, another projected eyewitness, namely, Shankargouda(PW-15), did not state about the presence of A- 4 at the time of incident. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166574806/ 3 Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 April, 2024 (vii) The trial Court further found that it was admitted by the eye witnesses(PW-6 and PW-15) that it had rained in the village continuously for three days prior to the incident and thus, the theory put forth by the complainant that the deceased and the four labourers(PW-2 to PW-5) had gone to the field for raising a bund was improbable as during the spell of incessant rainfall, it would not have been possible to carry out such an operation and for that matter, any other farming activity. 9. At para 15 of the judgment, the trial Court concluded as below: - “…In view of conflicting nature of evidence of these eye witnesses, it is clear that their evidence is not consistent with the prosecution case and it has a different version with reference to each witness. Hence a serious doubt arises as to the truthfulness of the prosecution.” 10. The trial Court discussed evidence of ASI, Tikota Police Station(PW-18), wherein he admitted that police visited the place of incident in the night only. It was also noted that complainant(PW-1) admitted that the complaint was made after the police had visited the place of incident. 11. PW-2 stated in his cross examination that the police came to the village at about 10 or 11 am and recorded his statement at the police station at that time only i.e. at 12 o’ clock. Taking this into consideration, the trial Court recorded a categoric finding that complaint(Exhibit P-1) was a post-investigation document and as such, it was hit by Section 162 CrPC and did not have any evidentiary worth. This conclusion was recorded in Para 17 of the judgment which is extracted hereinbelow for the sake of ready reference: - “According to the cross – examination of P.W.2, the police came to the village at about 10 or 11 a.m. He called by the police and they went to the place and the police inspected the dead body. P.W.2 is very much specific that they went to the place along with the police at 11p.m. and thereafter went to the police station at 12 O’ clock in the night. According to P.W.2, the police have recorded his statement in the police station at that time only i.e., at 12 O clock. This goes to show that the police were aware of the offence at 11.00 p.m. on 19.09.2001. P.W.6., who claims to be an eye witness, returned to the house at about 5-00 or 6-00 p.m. and informed the incident to the children of his uncle viz., he informed Pargouda, Shankargouda and Chanagouda. But, however, P.W.1 was hiding near the bushes at his land and if what P.W.6 says is true, then in that case, P.W.1 was in the house at 5-00 or 6-00 pm only. Nothing prevented P.W.1 to rush immediately to the police station which was 10 Kms away and to file the complaint. Even P.W.6 further admits that he told the incident to these persons and they had told him that they will go to the police station and it was 6-00 or 7-00 p.m., at the time. Even if that is the case, P.W.1 has to offer explanation as to why he filed the complaint at 4.00 a.m. When the admissions of this witness are taken into account, the police were aware of the murder at about 11 p.m. in the night and they had even visited the place of offence. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166574806/ 4 Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 April, 2024 Nothing prevented the police who visited the place of offence to record the statement of P.W.1 at his house and the delay for six hours as per the evidence of P.W.1 or as to the evidence of P.W.6, the delay of eight hours is not explained by the prosecution. If already the statements of the witnesses were recorded at the village only after seeing the dead body, then in that case Ex.P1 which is the complaint, is hit by Section 162 of CrPC and cannot have evidentiary value.” 12. The trial Court also concluded that the opinion of the Medical Officer regarding time of death of the deceased totally contradicted the case set up by the prosecution witnesses in their evidence regarding the time of incident. 13. Regarding the seizure of weapons/articles, the trial Court noted at para 19 that the complainant(PW-1) admitted in his cross- examination that the police had shown him the weapons of offence on the date of incident itself. However, as per the Investigating Officer(PW-27), the weapons were shown to have been recovered on 1st October, 2001 and, therefore, evidence of complainant(PW- 1) totally contradicted the claim of the Investigating Officer(PW-27) that he had seized the weapons in furtherance of the disclosure statements of the accused. 14. Taking note of these inherent lacunae, infirmities and contradictions in the prosecution evidence, the trial Court proceeded to hold that the prosecution case was full of inconsistencies and infirmities and that it had failed to prove the charges against the accused beyond all manner of doubt. Accordingly, the accused appellants(A-1, A-2 and A-3) and other three accused(A-4, A-5 and A-6) were acquitted of the charges. 15. The State preferred an appeal under Section 378(1) read with 378(3) CrPC challenging the acquittal of the accused. The learned Division Bench of High Court of Karnataka partly allowed the said appeal vide judgment dated 14th September, 2009 and while reversing the acquittal of the accused A-1, A-2 and A-3 as recorded by the trial Court, convicted and sentenced them as above. The appeal against A-4 stood abated on account of his death. The appeal against A-5 and A-6 was dismissed upholding their acquittal. 16. The instant appeal has been instituted at the instance of the accused appellants(A-1, A-2 and A-3) for assailing the judgment dated 14th September, 2009 rendered by the learned Division Bench of the High Court of Karnataka, Circuit Bench, Gulbarga whereby the acquittal of the appellants has been reversed and they have been convicted and sentenced to suffer life imprisonment. Submissions on behalf of the appellants: - 17. Learned counsel representing the appellants urged that the view taken by the High Court in reversing the acquittal of the appellants recorded by the trial Court by a well-reasoned judgment is totally contrary to the settled principles laid down by this Court regarding scope of interference in an appeal against acquittal. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166574806/ 5 Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 April, 2024 18. Learned counsel urged that the appellate Court should be very slow to intervene with the acquittal of an accused as recorded by the trial Court. Acquittal can be reversed only if the findings recorded by the trial Court are found to be patently illegal or perverse or if the only view possible on the basis of the evidence available on record points towards the guilt of the accused. If two views are possible, the acquittal recorded by the trial Court should not be interfered with unless perversity or misreading of evidence is reflected from the judgment recording acquittal. 19. Learned counsel further urged that the learned Division Bench of the High Court, while rendering the judgment reversing acquittal of the appellant barely referred to the findings on the basis of which the trial Court had acquitted the accused by extending them the benefit of doubt. Rather, the High Court went on to record its own fresh conclusions after re-appreciation of the evidence. Such an approach is de hors the well-settled principles governing consideration of an appeal against acquittal and hence, the impugned judgment deserves to be set aside. 20. They advanced pertinent submissions assailing the judgment of the High Court seeking acquittal of the accused appellants. 21. It was urged that the complainant(PW-1), father of the deceased Malagounda and the four labourers(PW-2, PW-3, PW-4 and PW-5) abandoned the deceased victim whom they claimed to have seen being belaboured with their own eyes. They neither made any efforts to take stock of the victim’s condition nor was the matter reported to the police promptly which makes it clear that the so called eye witnesses actually never saw the incident happening with their own eyes and a case of blind murder has been foisted upon the appellants on account of prior enmity. 22. The attention of this Court was drawn to the following excerpts from the evidence of complainant, Chanagouda(PW-1):- “….Again I returned back and went near my land and entered the bushes to hide myself. I sat at that place up to 6 or 7 PM in the evening. After the sun-set I returned to my village. I told the incident to my family members. In the night myself and my brothers and relatives went to the place and saw the dead body. Thereafter we informed to the police. The cousins informed about the incident to the police. At that time the police came to our house and took me to the police station. The police enquired me and I informed them about the incident and they made a writing. It was about 2 or 3 AM in the morning. In the morning hours the police came to the place. I now see the complaint at ex.P.1, and it bears my signature at Ex.p.1(a)…. ….The police recorded what I have stated to them in the police station. Thereafter I signed to that writing. On the next day the police have taken my statement. The Poujadar recorded my statement. The inspector also questioned me. It is not correct to suggest that the inspector has not recorded my statement….. ….My relatives did not made a telephone call and personally went to the police station and brought the police. At that time initially the police came and thereafter the Poujadar came. They came to our house. The poujadar questioned me what has happened. I told the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166574806/ 6 Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 April, 2024 Poujadar what I was knowing. The poujadar made a writing about it. The writing was made after the police visited the place of incident….. …..Myself and my relatives went to see the dead body in the night and at that time it was 10 to 11 PM. When we returned to house it was 10 or 11 PM. Phone facilities are available in our village. I did not made any telephone call to the police. I also did not tell-to my relatives to make a telephone call to the police station. Shivanagouda and Banagouda are my other two sons. Both of them are educated. They were present in the house when I returned from the land. When I told my son about the incident, they went on motor-cycle to the police station but did not made any telephone call to the police station. My son Shivanagouda and Sangond went on the motor-cycle to the police station. They went to the police station at about 12 o’clock in the night. The distance between Tikota Police Station and my village is 10 KMS….. ….On the day of incident only the police showed the weapon of offence..” (emphasis supplied) 23. In this very context, the attention of the Court was drawn to the evidence of ASI Tikota Police Station(PW-18), who recorded the FIR(Exhibit P-10) wherein he admitted that he did not know whether prior to 4.00 am on that day, the information of the murder was already provided at the police station. 24. Learned counsel thus urged that the police had already been informed about the incident by none other than the sons of the complainant(PW-1) around 12 o’ clock in the night and hence, there was no reason as to why the FIR was not registered immediately on receiving such information. 25. Learned counsel contended that the complainant(PW-1) admitted in cross examination that the Poujadar scribed a complaint and he was made to append his signatures thereupon. It was submitted that the said complaint was not produced on record. Hence, there is a genuine doubt regarding the FIR(Exhibit P-10) being a subsequently created post investigation document. 26. He then referred to the statement of Revappa(PW-2) who admitted in cross-examination that the police came to the village at about 10 or 11 pm and he was sleeping in his house when the call came from the police. A police officer from Tikota Police Station came to call him. He along with the police officer went to the place of incident where the dead body was lying. The time was about 11.00 pm. They went to the police station at 12 o’ clock in the night where his statement was recorded. 27. The Court was taken through the statement of Hiragappa(PW-4) who also stated that police came to their village at 8.00 or 9.00 pm in the night. They inquired from him and he divulged as to how the incident had happened. He and the other witnesses were questioned and their statements were noted whereafter they proceeded to the crime scene. They all went to the police station at about 11.00 pm in the night. He travelled in the police jeep. His statement was again recorded at the Police Station around 12’o clock or 1.00 am. 28. Learned counsel also referred to the statement of Basagonda(PW-6) who claimed to be an eye witness of the incident and urged that the witness stated about the presence of only two servants with the deceased Malagounda while he was allegedly being assaulted by the accused. Most Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166574806/ 7 Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 April, 2024 significantly, he did not state about the presence of the complainant(PW-1) at the crime scene. PW-6 admitted in his cross-examination that he returned to his house at about 5 to 6 pm and informed about the incident to the children of his uncle and Paragouda, Shankargouda and Chanagouda(PW-1). Many people had gathered when he spoke about the incident. It was submitted that this version of PW-6 completely belies and eclipses the claim of the complainant(PW-1) that he had seen the incident with his own eyes because, if the complainant(PW-1) had himself witnessed the occurrence, there was no occasion for PW-6 to collect all the family members including the complainant(PW-1) and inform them about the incident. 29. The evidence of PW-15, another alleged eye witnesses was criticised and it was submitted that the conduct of this witness who happens to be a cousin of PW-1, in casually going away to his farmland despite witnessing the brutal assault and not taking any steps to inform the police or the close relatives clearly shows that he is a cooked up witness and was not present at the crime scene. 30. The statement of Dr. Anil Kumar(PW-17) was referred to and it was submitted that the Medical Jurist conducted autopsy upon the dead body at about 9.00 am on 20th September, 2001 and gave pertinent opinion that the time of death of the victim was 18 to 24 hours before the autopsy being carried out. In cross-examination, he admitted that decomposition had set in the dead body and that the time of death was more than 24 hours prior to the examination. Thus, it was submitted that the time of incident as portrayed in the evidence given by the so called eye witnesses is totally contradicted by the opinion of the Medical Jurist. 31. It was also contended that the Investigating Officer(PW-27) has given false evidence regarding the disclosure statements made by the accused and the recoveries of the weapons effected in furtherance thereof, because the complainant(PW-1) clearly admitted in his evidence that the police had showed him the weapons on the very day of the incident. 32. It was also contended that neither the disclosure statements nor the recovery memos bear the signatures/thumb impressions of the accused and hence, the recoveries cannot be read in evidence or attributed to the accused appellants. 33. Learned counsel for the appellants vehemently urged that the learned Division Bench of the High Court was not justified in causing interference into the well-reasoned judgment of acquittal rendered by the learned trial Court and reversing the acquittal of the accused appellants and that too, without recording any finding that the trial Court’s judgment was perverse or that no view except the one warranting conviction of the accused was possible upon appreciation of evidence as available on record. On these grounds, he implored the court to set aside the impugned judgment and restore the acquittal of the appellants. Submissions on behalf of Respondent-State: - 34. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the respondent State vehemently and fervently opposed the submissions advanced by learned counsel for the appellants. He urged that learned Division Bench of the High Court, while considering the appeal against acquittal, thoroughly Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166574806/ 8 Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 April, 2024 reappreciated the evidence available on record and arrived at an independent and well considered conclusion that the depositions of the eye witnesses PW-1, PW-2, PW-4, PW-6 and PW-15 were convincing and did not suffer from any significant contradictions or infirmities so as to justify the decision of the trial Court in discarding their evidence and acquitting the accused of the charges. The FIR(Exhibit P-10) was promptly lodged at 4.00 am in the morning of 20th September, 2001. There was no such delay in lodging the report which could cast a doubt on the truthfulness of the prosecution story. The so called contradictions and discrepancies highlighted by the trial Court in the evidence of the eyewitnesses for doubting their evidentiary worth are trivial and insignificant and acquittal of accused as recorded by the learned trial Court disregarding the testimony of the eyewitnesses is based on perverse and unacceptable reasoning. Learned counsel thus urged that the High Court was perfectly justified in reversing the acquittal of the accused appellants by the impugned judgment which does not require interference in this appeal. 35. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the submissions made at bar and have gone through the judgments of the trial Court and High Court as well as the evidence available on record. Discussion and Conclusion: - 36. First of all, we would like to reiterate the principles laid down by this Court governing the scope of interference by the High Court in an appeal filed by the State for challenging acquittal of the accused recorded by the trial Court. 37. This Court in the case of Rajesh Prasad v. State of Bihar and Another1 encapsulated the legal position covering the field after considering various earlier judgments and held as below: - “29. After referring to a catena of judgments, this Court culled out the following general principles regarding the powers of the appellate court while dealing with an appeal against an order of 1 (2022) 3 SCC 471 acquittal in the following words: (Chandrappa case [Chandrappa v. State of Karnataka, (2007) 4 SCC 415] “42. From the above decisions, in our considered view, the following general principles regarding powers of the appellate court while dealing with an appeal against an order of acquittal emerge: (1) An appellate court has full power to review, reappreciate and reconsider the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded. (2) The Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 puts no limitation, restriction or condition on exercise of such power and an appellate court on the evidence before it may reach its own conclusion, both on questions of fact and of law. (3) Various expressions, such as, “substantial and compelling reasons”, “good and sufficient grounds”, “very strong circumstances”, “distorted conclusions”, “glaring mistakes”, etc. are not intended to curtail extensive powers of an appellate court in an appeal against acquittal. Such phraseologies are more in the nature of “flourishes of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166574806/ 9 Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 April, 2024 language” to emphasise the reluctance of an appellate court to interfere with acquittal than to curtail the power of the court to review the evidence and to come to its own conclusion. (4) An appellate court, however, must bear in mind that in case of acquittal, there is double presumption in favour of the accused. Firstly, the presumption of innocence is available to him under the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that every person shall be presumed to be innocent unless he is proved guilty by a competent court of law. Secondly, the accused having secured his acquittal, the presumption of his innocence is further reinforced, reaffirmed and strengthened by the trial court. (5) If two reasonable conclusions are possible on the basis of the evidence on record, the appellate court should not disturb the finding of acquittal recorded by the trial court.” 38. Further, in the case of H.D. Sundara & Ors. v. State of Karnataka2 this Court summarized the principles governing the exercise of appellate jurisdiction while dealing with an appeal against acquittal under Section 378 of CrPC as follows: - “8.1. The acquittal of the accused further strengthens the presumption of innocence; 8.2. The appellate court, while hearing an appeal against acquittal, is entitled to reappreciate the oral and documentary evidence; 8.3. The appellate court, while deciding an appeal against acquittal, after reappreciating the evidence, is required to consider whether the view taken by the trial court is a possible view which could have been taken on the basis of the evidence on record; 8.4. If the view taken is a possible view, the appellate court cannot overturn the order of acquittal on the ground that another view was also possible; and 8.5. The appellate court can interfere with the order of acquittal only if it comes to a finding that the only conclusion which can be recorded on the basis of the evidence on record was that the guilt of the accused was proved beyond a reasonable doubt and no other conclusion was possible.” 39. Thus, it is beyond the pale of doubt that the scope of interference by an appellate Court for reversing the judgment of acquittal recorded by the trial Court in favour of the accused has to be exercised within the four corners of the following principles:- 2 (2023) 9 SCC 581 (a) That the judgment of acquittal suffers from patent perversity; Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166574806/ 10 Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 April, 2024 (b) That the same is based on a misreading/omission to consider material evidence on record; (c) That no two reasonable views are possible and only the view consistent with the guilt of the accused is possible from the evidence available on record. 40. The appellate Court, in order to interfere with the judgment of acquittal would have to record pertinent findings on the above factors if it is inclined to reverse the judgment of acquittal rendered by the trial Court. 41. In light of the above legal principles, if we go through the impugned judgment, we find that none of these essential mandates governing an appeal against acquittal were adverted to by learned Division Bench of the High Court which proceeded to virtually decide the appeal as a first Court on independent appreciation of evidence and recorded its own findings to hold the accused appellants(A-1, A-2 and A-3) guilty of the charge under Section 302 read with Section 34 IPC and sentenced them to imprisonment for life. 42. Thus, on the face of record, the judgment of the High Court causing interference with the acquittal of the accused appellants as recorded by the trial Court is contrary to the principles established by law. 43. Keeping the above scenario in mind, we now proceed to analyse the evidence and shall assign our reasons regarding the impugned judgment being flawed, with reference to the material infirmities and lacunae in the prosecution case. 44. The place of occurrence is admittedly at a distance of 10 kms from Police Station Tikota. The complainant(PW-1), father of the deceased Malagounda claiming to be an eye witness of the incident deposed that he lodged a complaint(Exhibit P-1) at the police station at 4 am, which resulted into registration of FIR(Exhibit P- 10). It was alleged in the report that the complainant along with PW-2, PW-3, PW-4 and PW-5(servants, who had accompanied the deceased Malagounda to erect a bund in their land) witnessed the incident wherein, the assailants including the appellants herein, assaulted and killed the deceased by inflicting injuries with sharp weapons. It may be noted that even though the complainant(PW- 1), the deceased and the labourers were all going together and the assailants were six in number, none other than the deceased Malagounda received a single injury in the incident. 45. Relevant portions from the evidence of complainant(PW-1) have been extracted and highlighted above and on going through the same, we find that his testimony suffers from patent infirmities, contradictions and inherent loopholes which brings him within the category of wholly unreliable witness. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166574806/ 11 Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 April, 2024 46. The complainant(PW-1) stated in his evidence that he saw the brutal assault launched by the appellants and A-4(Sahebagouda) on his son Malagounda which took place at 4.00 pm or 5.00 pm in the evening of 19th September, 2001. While the incident was going on, he hid amongst the bushes so as to avoid being harmed by the assailants. The complainant did not state anything about the accused going away from the crime scene after the incident. However, he claimed that he returned back to his house just after sunset. The incident took place in the month of September and thus, it can be presumed that sunset must have occurred around 6:15 to 6.30 pm. The complainant stated that on reaching home, he divulged about the incident to his family members and soon thereafter, he and his cousins (as per his version in examination- in-chief) and his sons Shivanagouda and Banagouda(as per cross- examination) went to the Police Station Tikota and informed the police about the incident. 47. Apparently, thus, the close relatives of the deceased had gone to the police station in the late hours of 19th September itself. If this version was true then, in natural course, these persons were bound to divulge about the incident to the police and their statement/s which would presumably be about an incident of the homicidal death would have mandatorily been entered in the Daily Dairy of the police station if not treated to be the FIR. However, the Daily Diary or the Roznamcha entry of the police station corresponding to the so called visit by the relatives of the deceased to the police station was not brought on record which creates a grave doubt on the genuineness of the FIR(Exhibit P-10). The complainant(PW-1) admitted in cross examination that the Poujadar came to his house and he narrated the incident to the officer who scribed the same and thereafter, the complainant appended his signatures on the writing made by the Poujadar. However, ASI Tikota Police Station(PW-18) testified on oath that complainant(PW-1) came to the police station and submitted a written report which was taken as the complaint of the incident. He did not state anything about any complaint being recorded at the house of the complainant prior to lodging of the report. Thus, there is a grave contradiction on this important aspect as to whether the report was submitted by the complainant(PW-1) in the form of a written complaint or whether the oral statement of complainant(PW-1) was recorded by the police officials at his home leading to the registration of FIR(Exhibit P-10). The non- production of the Daily Dairy maintained at the police station assumes great significance in the backdrop of these facts. Apparently thus, the FIR(Exhibit P-10) is a post investigation document and does not inspire confidence. 48. Shivanagouda and Banagouda, the educated sons of the complainant(PW-1), who were the first persons to approach the police station(as stated by PW-1 in cross-examination) were not examined by the prosecution. The complainant(PW-1) also stated that his relatives personally went to the police station and brought the police to the village. The factum of the police having arrived at the village at about 10.00 pm or 11.00 pm was also stated by PW- 2 and PW-4. 49. A very important fact which is evident from the evidence of Basagonda(PW-6) who claimed to be an eye witness of the incident is that he did not state about the presence of the complainant(PW- 1) at the place of incident while the victim was being assaulted. PW-6 stated that he returned to his house at about 5.00 pm or 6.00 pm and then he informed the family members, i.e., Paragouda, Shankargouda and Chanagouda(PW-1). Thus, the case set up by prosecution that complainant, Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166574806/ 12 Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 April, 2024 Chanagouda(PW-1) was an eye-witness to the incident, is totally contradicted by evidence of PW-6 who categorically stated that it was he who had informed the family members, the informant Chanagouda (PW-1) being one of them, about the incident at 6.00 or 7.00 pm and that they responded saying that they would be going to the police station for filing a report. 50. Thus, the claim of complainant(PW-1) that he was an eye witness to the incident is totally contradicted by the statement of PW-6. The conduct of the family members of the deceased and the other villagers in not taking any steps to protect the dead body for the whole night and instead, casually going back to their houses without giving a second thought as to what may happen to the mortal remains of the deceased, lying exposed to the elements is another circumstance which creates a grave doubt in the mind of the Court that no one had actually seen the incident and it was a case of blind murder which came to light much later. As a matter of fact, if at all the sequence of events as emanating from the evidence of the prosecution witnesses was having even a grain of truth, then it cannot be believed that the dead body would be abandoned in this manner or that even the police officials would not put a guard at the crime scene. 51. Added to that, the version of Medical Jurist(PW-17) who stated in his cross-examination that the dead body of the deceased Malagounda was in a stage of decomposition and that the time of death was more than 24 hours prior to the autopsy done at 9.00 a.m. on 20th September, 2001 creates further doubt in the mind of the Court on the theory of the so called eye witnesses that the incident happened at 4.00 pm on 19th September, 2001. 52. The witnesses Revappa(PW-2), Basagonda(PW-6) and Shankargouda(PW-15) admitted that it had been raining incessantly in the village for almost three days. In such circumstances, the reason assigned by the complainant(PW-1) for the deceased Malagounda and the four servants(PW-2, PW-3, PW- 4 and PW-5) to have gone to the agricultural land, i.e., for putting up a bund is totally unacceptable. Since it was raining incessantly, there could not be any possibility for these people to have made an attempt to put up a bund on the land. 53. Thus, there is no logical explanation for the presence of the deceased and the servants in their field on the date and time of the incident. It seems that not only did the complainant party create eye witnesses of the incident but has also suppressed the true genesis of the occurrence. 54. PW-1 and PW-6 admitted that Sangound, son of the accused A-4 had been murdered in front of their house and that the accused party was carrying a grudge that deceased Malagounda had murdered the boy. PW-6 also admitted that deceased Malagounda, his father[(complainant)(PW-1)] and two brothers(Shivanagouda and Banagouda) were arraigned as accused for the murder of Sangound(son of A-4). The incident of murder of Sangound happened two years prior which is far too remote in point of time so as to impute motive to the appellants that in order to seek revenge, they had murdered the deceased Malagounda. 55. It has been laid down by this Court in a catena of decisions that motive acts as a double-edged sword. Hence, the very fact that members of the prosecution party were arraigned as accused in the murder of Sangound, son of A-4, this could also have been the motive for the prosecution witness to Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166574806/ 13 Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 April, 2024 rope in the accused appellants for the murder of Malagounda. 56. The High Court heavily relied upon the circumstance of recoveries of weapons made at the instance of the accused as incriminating evidence. However, as was rightly pointed out by learned counsel representing the accused appellants, the complainant(PW-1) admitted in his cross-examination that he was shown the weapons of the offence by the police on the date of incident itself. 57. At this stage, we would like to note that the Investigating Officer(PW-27) who investigated the matter, claims to have effected the recoveries in furtherance of the disclosure statements of the accused and testified as below to prove the procedure of disclosure and the discoveries: - “On 1.10.2001 PSI Tikota produced accused Babusaheb Sahebgouda Biradar and Alagond Sahebgouda Biradar who were interrogated and recorded vol. statement of both accused persons. I now see the vol. statement or Alagond which is at Ex.P.15. It bears my signature and the LTM of Alagond. I now see the vol. statement of Babu and it is marked as Ex.P.16 and it bears my signature and the LTM of Babu Biradar. I recorded vol. statement of Babu Sahebgouda Pudragoudar and Alagond Sahebgouda Biradar. And accordingly conducted seizure panchanama and seized two axes and one koyta produced by Pudragoudar i.e. Babu Sahebgouda Pudragoudar, in the field of Anasari. And accordingly also seized one Jambiya produced by Alagond Biradar. I recorded the statements of Krishnaji Govindappa Kulkarni. On 2.10.2001 produced both the accused before the Hon’ble Court. On 3.10.01 I arrested accused Mudakappa Gadigoppa@Sahebgouda Pudragoudar and the interrogated to him and also recorded his voluntary statement. As per the vol. st. conducted seizure panchanama and seized two sickles, 0 pen shirt which was blood stained, bush-shirt which was blood stained which were belonging to accd. Gradi and one plastic carry bag.Which articles are kept in land of Basappa Gradi.” 58. We would now discuss about the requirement under law so as to prove a disclosure statement recorded under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872(hereinafter being referred to as ‘Evidence Act’) and the discoveries made in furtherance thereof. 59. The statement of an accused recorded by a police officer under Section 27 of the Evidence Act is basically a memorandum of confession of the accused recorded by the Investigating Officer during interrogation which has been taken down in writing. The confessional part of such statement is inadmissible and only the part which distinctly leads to discovery of fact is admissible in evidence as laid down by this Court in the case of State of Uttar Pradesh v. Deoman Upadhyaya3. 60. Thus, when the Investigating Officer steps into the witness box for proving such disclosure statement, he would be required to narrate what the accused stated to him. The Investigating Officer essentially testifies about the conversation held between AIR 1960 SC 1125 himself and the accused which has been taken down into writing leading to the discovery of incriminating fact(s). Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166574806/ 14 Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 April, 2024 61. As per Section 60 of the Evidence Act, oral evidence in all cases must be direct. The section leaves no ambiguity and mandates that no secondary/hearsay evidence can be given in case of oral evidence, except for the circumstances enumerated in the section. In case of a person who asserts to have heard a fact, only his evidence must be given in respect of the same. 62. The manner of proving the disclosure statement under Section 27 of the Evidence Act has been the subject matter of consideration by this Court in various judgments, some of which are being referred to below. 63. In the case of Mohd. Abdul Hafeez v. State of Andhra Pradesh4, it was held by this Court as follows: - “5. ….If evidence otherwise confessional in character is admissible under Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, it is obligatory upon the Investigating Officer to state and record who gave the information; when he is dealing with more than one accused, what words were used by him so that a recovery pursuant to the information received may be connected to the person giving the information so as to provide incriminating evidence against that person.” (1983) 1 SCC 143 64. Further, in the case of Subramanya v. State of Karnataka5, it was held as under: - “82. Keeping in mind the aforesaid evidence, we proceed to consider whether the prosecution has been able to prove and establish the discoveries in accordance with law. Section 27 of the Evidence Act reads thus: “27. How much of information received from accused may be proved. — Provided that, when any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of information received from a person accused of any offence, in the custody of a police officer, so much of such information, whether it amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered, may be proved.” 83. The first and the basic infirmity in the evidence of all the aforesaid prosecution witnesses is that none of them have deposed the exact statement said to have been made by the appellant herein which ultimately led to the discovery of a fact relevant under Section 27 of the Evidence Act. 84. If, it is say of the investigating officer that the accused appellant while in custody on his own free will and volition made a statement that he would lead to the place where he had hidden the weapon of offence, the site of burial of the dead body, clothes etc., then the first thing that the investigating officer should have done was to call for two independent witnesses at the police station itself. Once the two independent witnesses would arrive at the police station thereafter in their presence the accused should be asked to make an appropriate statement as he may desire in regard to pointing out the place where he is said to have hidden the weapon of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166574806/ 15 Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 April, 2024 offence etc. When the accused while in custody makes such statement before the two independent witnesses (panch-witnesses) the exact statement or rather the exact words uttered by the accused should be incorporated in the first part of the panchnama that the investigating officer may draw in accordance with law. This first part of the panchnama for the purpose of Section 27 of the Evidence Act is always drawn at the police station in the presence of the independent witnesses so as to lend credence that a particular statement was made by the accused expressing his willingness on his own free will and volition to point out the place 2022 SCC Online SC 1400 where the weapon of offence or any other article used in the commission of the offence had been hidden. Once the first part of the panchnama is completed thereafter the police party along with the accused and the two independent witnesses (panch-witnesses) would proceed to the particular place as may be led by the accused. If from that particular place anything like the weapon of offence or blood stained clothes or any other article is discovered then that part of the entire process would form the second part of the panchnama. This is how the law expects the investigating officer to draw the discovery panchnama as contemplated under Section 27 of the Evidence Act. If we read the entire oral evidence of the investigating officer then it is clear that the same is deficient in all the aforesaid relevant aspects of the matter.” (emphasis supplied) 65. Similar view was taken by this Court in the case of Ramanand @ Nandlal Bharti v. State of Uttar Pradesh6, wherein this Court held that mere exhibiting of memorandum prepared by the Investigating Officer during investigation cannot tantamount to proof of its contents. While testifying on oath, the Investigating Officer would be required to narrate the sequence of events which transpired leading to the recording of the disclosure statement. 66. If we peruse the extracted part of the evidence of the Investigating Officer(PW-27)(reproduced supra), in the backdrop of the above exposition of law laid down by this Court, the interrogation memos of the accused A-2(Exhibit P-15) and A-1 (Exhibit P-16), it is clear that the Investigating Officer(PW-27) gave 2022 SCC OnLine SC 1396 no description at all of the conversation which had transpired between himself and the accused which was recorded in the disclosure statements. Thus, these disclosure statements cannot be read in evidence and the recoveries made in furtherance thereof are non est in the eyes of law. 67. The Investigating Officer(PW-27) also stated that in furtherance of the voluntary statements of accused(A-1 and A-2), he recovered and seized two axes and one koyta produced by A-1 in the field of Ansari and one jambiya produced by A-2. The Investigating Officer(PW-27) nowhere stated in his deposition that the disclosure statement of the accused resulted into the discovery of these weapons pursuant to being pointed out by the accused. 68. The Investigating Officer(PW-27) further stated that he arrested accused A-3, recorded his voluntary statement and seized two sickles. However, neither the so called voluntary statement nor the seizure memo were proved by the Investigating Officer(PW- Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/166574806/ 16 Babu Sahebagouda Rudragoudar vs The State Of Karnataka on 19 April, 2024 27) in his evidence. 69. Thus, we are of the firm opinion that neither the disclosure memos were proved in accordance with law nor the recovery of the weapons from open spaces inspire confidence and were wrongly relied upon by the High Court as incriminating material so as to reverse the finding of the acquittal recorded by the trial Court. 70. The evidence of seizure of weapons of the offence is not trustworthy and was rightly discarded by the trial Court. 71. In addition thereto, we may note that admittedly, the prosecution did not procure any serological opinion to establish blood group, if any, on the weapons so recovered. Thus, the recoveries are otherwise also meaningless and an exercise in futility. 72. Thus, neither the evidence of the eye witness is trustworthy nor did the prosecution provide any corroboration to the vacillating evidence of the so called eye witnesses. We have already held that the FIR(Exhibit P-10) was a post investigation document. Thus, the entire prosecution case comes under the shadow of doubt. 73. Resultantly, we are of the firm opinion that the view taken by the trial Court in the judgment dated 23rd July, 2005 recording acquittal of accused is a plausible and justifiable view emanating from the discussion of the evidence available on record. The trial Court’s judgment does not suffer from any infirmity or perversity. Hence, the High Court was not justified in reversing the well- reasoned judgment of the trial Court thereby turning the acquittal of the accused appellants into conviction. 74. The impugned judgment dated 14th September, 2009 rendered by the High Court cannot be sustained and is hereby reversed. The accused appellants are acquitted of all the charges. They are on bail and need not surrender. Their bail bonds are discharged. 75. The appeal stands allowed accordingly. 76. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. …………………………J. (B.R.

This application under Article 32 of the Constitution of India for a writ of 'habeas corpus' made by Ashutosh Lahiry at present detained in District Jail, Delhi, under an order of detention passed on the 1st April 1950 by the District Magistrate of Delhi under the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 raises two questions, namely: (1) that the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 takes away or abridges the fundamental rights of the Indian citizens conferred by Part III of the Constitution and is accordingly void under Article 13(2) of the Constitution; and (2) that the Order of detention has been made 'mala fide' and is an abuse of power and as such void, illegal and inoperative. The first question mentioned above is now concluded by the decision of this Court which, by a majority, upheld the validity of the impugned Act except as to certain provisions which were held to be severable. The provisions which were held to be bad have no bearing on the present case. 2. In order to determine the second question it will be necessary to state a few facts. The petitioner is a member of the Hindu Mahasabha. He is a representative of the Bengal Hindu Mahasabha on the Working Committee as well as on the All India Committee of that organization. In the recent past there were serious communal disturbances in East Bengal in course of which there were, as alleged, extensive killings of Hindu minorities and abduction of Hindu women. This resulted in a large scale migration of Hindus from East Bengal into West Bengal which, it is stated, is still in progress. There can be no question that Hindu feelings were and are running high and communal incidents and repercussions took place in West Bengal also. A large number of refugees poured into West Bengal and particularly in Calcutta. The petitioner actively took part in the relief work undertaken by the Hindu Mahasabha and actively co-operated with the Bengal Chief Minister (Dr. B. C. Roy) in the work. On 5-3-1950 the Prime Minister of India visited Calcutta to study the situation on the spot. There was a move to hold a 'hartal' on that day. The petitioner issued a Press statement deprecating such move as ill-advised and called upon the citizens not to join in the 'hartal'. The petitioner claims that as a result of his appeal the 'hartal' fell through. The petitioner is said to have interviewed the Prime Minister in connection with relief work. It appears that there was a public meeting in Delhi on or about 19-3-1950. It is alleged that intemperate speeches were delivered at this meeting touching the communal situation in East Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/861263/ 1 Ashutosh Lahiry vs The State Of Delhi And Anr. on 19 May, 1950 Bengal and that such speeches led to a communal riot in Delhi on 19-3-1950. On 23-3-1950 the petitioner came to Delhi for, he says, attending the Board meeting of a company of which he is a director. On 27-3-1950 the petitioner held a Press conference at Delhi where, it is alleged, he gave a highly exaggerated and communal version of the happenings in Bengal and East Bengal. No report of the Press conference, however, was published by the authorities. On 28-3-1950 the petitioner returned to Calcutta where he ordinarily resides. A meeting of the Working Committee and a meeting of the All India Committee of the Hindu Mahasabha were called by its President for the 1st and the 2nd April 1950, the notices having been issued on 15-3-1950. The object of these meetings was to discuss the situation in Bengal with special reference to the large influx of refugees. These were not public meetings. The meetings were, however, banned and the President, the General Secretary, the Organising Secretary and others were externed from Delhi on the 1st April 1950. On the same day at 8-45 p.m. a detention order dated 31-3-1950 was served on the petitioner. On the 3rd April the following grounds of detention were served on the petitioner under Section 7 of the Act: ""You came to Delhi on March 27, 1950 and held a press conference in which you gave a highly exaggerated and communal version of happenings in Bengal and East Bengal. It is understood that since after the press conference your activities have continued to be of a nature inciting communal passions. It has also come to notice that your activities during your stay in West Bengal had also been of a communal nature. Your activities in the present atmosphere in Delhi where a communal riot took place on March 19, 1950 as a result of the intemperate statements made in a public meeting, are likely to create hatred between different communities which may lead to disturbance of public peace and order."" The petitioner alleges that his object in coming to Delhi was not to create any communal bitterness. He came here in March 1950 to attend a Board meeting. It is true that he held a Press conference but no report was published in any newspaper and, therefore, there can be no question of his comments having created any mischief even if they were highly communal, which is denied. On the 1st April, 1950 he came to attend the two meetings but the meetings were banned and no mischief can possibly be said to have been done. All the important leaders of the Mahasabha had been externed from Delhi and the meetings were banned by the Government in order to prevent persons opposing the Congress Governments from criticising the policy of the party in power. The Prime Minister of Pakistan had come or was due to come to Delhi at or about that time and all these steps were taken to prevent the ventilation of the genuine feelings of the people. In particular, the petitioner was co-operating with Bengal Government in the relief and rehabilitation work and there could be no justification for taking the petitioner into custody. 3. The District Magistrate of Delhi has filed an affidavit in opposition to this application. He states that before he made the Order he satisfied himself from reports and information from persons experienced in investigating matters of this kind and whose duty is to make such investigations and Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/861263/ 2 Ashutosh Lahiry vs The State Of Delhi And Anr. on 19 May, 1950 report the same to him confidentially that it was necessary to detain the petitioner with a view to preventing him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. 4. It is now well settled that the satisfaction of the authority making the order as to the matters specified in the Act is the only condition for the exercise of his powers and that the Court cannot substitute its own satisfaction for that of the authority. It is, however, open to the detenu to establish, if he can, that the order was made 'mala fide' and in abuse of powers. The facts and circumstances set forth in the petition and in the affidavit in reply and summarised above are calculated to give rise to a certain amount of suspicion in the mind of the Court. The recourse of the drastic order for detention rather than to a preventive order under Section 144. Criminal P. C., lends some colour to the petitioner's contention. Suspicion, however, is not proof and I am not convinced that the act of the District Magistrate was actuated by any improper or indirect motive. The communal situation in Delhi was tense. In fact there was a communal riot on the 19th March 1950. The petitioner held a Press conference where he is alleged to have given a highly exaggerated and communal version of the happenings in Bengal. The District Magistrate, in these circumstances, felt satisfied, he says, that it was necessary to take action against the petitioner. I am not prepared to say that in view of the prevailing situation his satisfaction was patently simulated. The petitioner's active participation in relief work to which reference has been made is not necessarily inconsistent with and does not exclude or rule out the possibility of his inflaming the communal passions of the Hindu refugees. In the premises, I am unable to accede to this petition, which must, therefore, stand dismissed. (The judgment of Mahajan and Mukherjea JJ. was delivered by Mukherjea J.) 5. This is an application for a writ of Ashutosh Lahiry who complains of illegal detention in the Delhi Jail in pursuance of an order of the District Magistrate of Delhi made under Section 3 (2) of the Preventive Detention Act. 6. Mr. Chatterjee, appearing for the petitioner, has raised a two-fold ground in support of the petition. His contention, in the first place, is that the Preventive Detention Act of 1950 is 'ultra vires' the Constitution and any detention made under its provisions is illegal and inoperative in law. He has argued, in the second place, that the facts of the case would establish that the order of detention is a 'mala fide' order, amounting to abuse of authority vested in the District Magistrate under the Preventive Detention Act. 7. So far as the first point is concerned, this court has held by a majority in the case of -- 'A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras', (A) that the Preventive Detention Act is not ultra vires the Constitution with the exception of Section 14 which, being severable from the rest of the Act, does not affect the validity of the latter in any way. Having regard to the pronouncement already made by this court, it is not possible to accept the first contention which has been raised by the learned counsel. 8. As regards the second ground, it is perfectly true that the order of detention may be declared invalid if it could be proved to have been made by the authority concerned in mala fide exercise of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/861263/ 3 Ashutosh Lahiry vs The State Of Delhi And Anr. on 19 May, 1950 their power. The burden of proving the absence of good faith is upon the petitioner and in cases of this description, it is certainly a heavy burden to discharge. 9. From the facts set out in the affidavit of the petitioner which have not been controverted by the respondents, it appears that the petitioner is a member of the Working Committee as well as of the All India Committee of the Hindu Mahasabha. He ordinarily resides in Calcutta, West Bengal, and came to Delhi on 23-3-1-950 to attend a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Bharat Publications Limited. On 27-3-1950 he held a Press Conference at Delhi and went back to Calcutta on the 28th. He came to Delhi again oh the 1st of April following, with a view to attend the meetings of the two committees of the Hindu Mahasabha spoken of above, which were scheduled to be held on the 1st and 2nd of April 1950. Before the meeting could be held, the President, General Secretary and Organizing Secretary of the Hindu Mahasabha were externed from Delhi on the 1st of April 1950, and on the same day an order was served upon the petitioner directing his detention under the Preventive Detention Act. 10. In the grounds of detention, which were served upon the petitioner under Section 7, Preventive Detention Act, it is stated as follows: ""You came to Delhi on March 27, 1950 and held a press conference in which you gave a highly exaggerated and communal version of happenings in Bengal and East Bengal. It is understood that since after the press conference your activities have continued to be of a nature inciting communal passions......Your activities in the present atmosphere in Delhi where a communal riot took place on March 19, 1950 as a result of the intemperate statements made in a public meeting, are likely to create hatred between different communities which may lead to disturbance of public peace and order."" 11. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I must assume that the facts stated in the grounds are all true and that the petitioner did give an exaggerated version of the happenings in East Bengal at the Press Conference held on 27-3-1950, although no report of this Conference was allowed to be published under the Orders of the District Magistrate. I may also take it that there was a communal disturbance at Delhi of some magnitude on 19-3-1950 and that in these circumstances the presence of the petitioner in this city was not considered desirable; but even then a doubt legitimately arises in one's mind as to the necessity or propriety of making use of the provisions of the Preventive Detention Act against the petitioner. As said above, he is not an inhabitant of this place and does not normally carry on his activities in Delhi. He resides habitually in West Bengal and came to Delhi only to attend certain meetings. If as the District Magistrate thought his presence at that time in Delhi might lead to disturbance of communal peace, there were certainly ample powers under the ordinary law which he could exercise for the purpose of preventing the mischief. There are provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code which could be invoked for such purposes. As a matter of fact, the meeting could not be held on the 1st of April as proposed, as the persons who were expected to take leading part in the same were externed from Delhi. It is somewhat difficult to see why a different treatment was meted out to the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/861263/ 4 Ashutosh Lahiry vs The State Of Delhi And Anr. on 19 May, 1950 petitioner and he was consigned to detention in jail for an indefinite period of time. There could be no better proof of 'mala fides' on the part of the executive authorities than a use of the extraordinary provisions contained in the Act for purposes for which ordinary law is quite sufficient. Though I am unable to hold definitely that there is want of good faith on the part of the authorities, the case is certainly not free from suspicion. I can only hope that the authorities will take care to see that no instances occur which might savour of injustice or oppression through misuse of those extraordinary powers which the Parliament has vested in the executive in the interests of the State itself. With these observations, I concur in the order made in this case that the application should be dismissed. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/861263/ 5"

HEADNOTE: The petitioner who was detained under the Preventive Detention Act (Act IV of 1950) applied under Art. 32 of the Constitution for a writ of habeas corpus and for his release from detention, on the ground that the said Act contravened the provisions of Arts. 13, 19, 21 and 22 of the Constitu- tion and was consequently ultra rites and that his detention was therefore illegal: Held, per KANIA C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ. (FAZL ALI and MAHAJAN JJ. dissentinq)--that the preventive Detention Act, 1950, with the exception of S ec. 14 thereof did not contravene any of the Articles of the Constitution and even though Sec. 14 was ultra rites inas- much as it contravened the provisions of Art. 9.9, (5) of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 3 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 the Constitution, as this section was severable from the remaining sections of the Act, the invalidity of Sec. 14 did not affect the validity of the Act as a whole, and the detention of the petitioner was not illegal. FAZL ALl and MAHAJAN JJ.--Section 12, of the Act was also ultra vires, and since it contravened the very provi- sion in the 89 Constitution under which the Parliament derived its compe- tence to enact the law, the detention was illegal. Held, by the Full Court (KANIA CJ., FAZL ALI, PATANJALI SASTRI, MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ.)--Section 14 of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950, contravenes the provisions of Art. 9.9. (5) of the Constitution in so far as it prohibits a person detained from disclosing to the Court the grounds on which a detention order has been made or the representation made by him against the order of detention, and is to that extent ultra vires and void. Per KANIA C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ. (FAZL ALI J. dissenting).--Article 19 of the Consti- tution has no application to a law which relates directly to preventive detention even though as a result of an order of detention the rights referred to in sub-cls. (a) to (e) and (g) in general, and sub-cl. (d) in particular, of cl. (1) of Art. 19 may be restricted or abridged; and the constitution- al validity of a law relating to such detention cannot therefore, be judged in the light of the test prescribed in el. (5) of the said Article. DAS J.--Article 19 (1) postulates a legal capacity to exercise the rights guaranteed by it and if a citizen loses the freedom of his person by reason of lawful detention as a result of a conviction for an offence or otherwise he cannot claim the right s under- sub-cls. (a) to (e) and (g) of Art. 19 (1); likewise if a citizen's property is compulsorily ac- quired under Art. 31, he cannot claim the right under sub- el. (f) of Art. 19 (1) with respect to that property. In short the rights under sub-cls. (a) to (e) and (g) end where lawful detention begins and therefore the validity of a preventive detention Act cannot be judged by Arc. 19 (5). MAHAJAN J.---Whatever be the precise scope of Art. 19 (1) (d) and Art.19(5) the provisions of Art. 19(5) do not apply to a law relating to preventive detention, inasmuch as 'there is a special self-contained provision in Art. 22 regulating it. FAZL ALI.J.--Preventive detention is a direct infringe- ment of the right guaranteed in Art. 19 (1) (d), even if a narrow construction is placed on the said sub-clause, and a law relating to preventive detention is therefore subject to such limited judicial review as is permitted by Art. 19 (5). Per KANIA C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ. (FAZL ALl J. dissenting).--The concept of the right ""to move Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 4 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 freely throughout the territory of India"" referred to in Art. 19 (1) (d), of the Constitution is entirely differ- ent from the concept of the right to ""personal liberty"" referred to in Art. 21, and Art. 19 should not, therefore, be read as controlled by the provisions of Art. 21. The view that Art. 19 guarantees substantive rights and Art. 21 prescribes the procedure is incorrect. DAs J.--Article 19 protects some of the important attributes of personal liber- ty as independent rights and the expression ""personal liber- ty"" is used in Art. 21 as a compendious term 90 including within Rs meaning all varieties of rights which go to make up the personal liberties of men. FAZL ALl J.--Even if it be assumed that Art. 19 (1) (d) does not refer to "" personal liberty"" and that it bears the restricted meaning attributed to it,that is to say, R signi- fies merely the right to move from one locality to another, preventive detention must be held to affect this limited right of movement directly and substantially. One of the objects of preventive detention is to restrain a person detained from moving from place to place so that he may not spread disaffection or indulge in dangerous activities in the places he visits. The same consideration applies to the cases of persons who are interned or externed. Hence, externment, interment and certain other forms of restriction on movement have always been treated as kindred matters belonging to the same group or family, and the rule which applies to one must necessarily apply to the others. Per KANIA C. J ,, PATANJALI SASTRI and DAS 35. (MAHAJAN 3. dissenting).--Article 22 does not form a complete code of constitutional safeguards relating to preventive detention. To the extent that provision is made in Art. 9.9, it cannot be controlled by Art. 9,1; but on points of procedure which expressly or by necessary implication are not dealt with by Art. 22, Art. 9.1 will apply. DAS J.--Art. 21 protects substantive rights by requiring a procedure and Art. 9.9. lays down the minimum rules of procedure that even the Parliament cannot abrogate or overlook. MAHAJAN J.--Art. 99. contains a self-contained code of constitutional safeguards relating to preventive detention and cannot be examined or controlled by the provisions of Art. 21. The principles underlying Art. 21 are however kept in view in Art. 22 and there is no conflict between these articles. MUKHERJEA J. --Even assuming that Art. 22 is not a self-contained code relating to preventive detention and that Art. 21 would apply, it is .not permissible to supplement Art. 22 by the application of rules of natural justice. FAZL ALI J.--Art. 22. does not form an exhaustive code by itself relating to preventive detention. Parliament can make further provi- sions and if it has done so Art. 19 (5) may be applied to see if those provisions have transgressed the bounds of reasonableness. Per KANIA C.J., MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ. (FAZL ALI J. dis- Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 5 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 senting).--In Art. 9.1 the word 'law"" has been used in the sense of State-made law and not as an equivalent of law in the abstract or general sense embodying the principles of natural justice; and ""procedure established by law"" means procedure established by law made by the State, that is to say, the Union Parliament or the Legislatures of the States. It is not proper to construe this expression in the light of the meaning given to.the expression ""due process of law"" in the American Constitution by the Supreme Court of America. FATANJALI SASTRI cl.-- ""Law"" in Art. 21 does not mean the jus naturale of civil law but means 91 positive or State-made law. ""Procedure established by law"" does not however mean any procedure which may be prescribed by a competent legislature, but the ordinary well-estab- lished criminal procedure, i.e., those settled. usages and normal modes of procedure sanctioned by the Criminal Proce- dure Code, which is the general law of criminal proce- dure in this country. The only alternative to this con- struction, if a constitutional transgression is to be avoid- ed is to interpret the reference to ""law"" as implying a constitutional 'amendment pro tanto, for it is only a law enacted by the procedure provided for such amendment that could modify or override a fundamental right without contra- vening Art. 13 (2). FAZL, ALI J.--There is nothing revolutionary in the view that ""procedure established by law ""must include the four principles of elementary justice which inhere in and are at the root of all civilized systems of law, and which have been stated by the American Courts and jurists as consisting in (1) notice, (2) opportunity to be heard, (3) impartial tribunal and (4) orderly course of procedure. These four principles are really different aspects of the same right, namely, the right to be heard before one is condemned. Hence the words ""procedure established by law "", whatever its exact meaning be, must necessarily include the principle that no person shall be condemned without hearing by an impartial tribunal. Per KANIA C.J., FAZL ALI, PATANJALI SASTRI, MAHAJAN and DAS JJ.--Section 3 of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950, does not delegate any legislative power to an executive officer but merely confers on such officer a discretion to enforce the law made by the legislature, and is not there- fore invalid on this ground. The fact that the section does not provide an objective standard for determining whether the requirements of law have been complied with, is not a ground for holding that it is invalid. FAZL ALI J.---Section 3 is however a reasonable provision only for the first step, i.e., for arrest and initial detention and must be followed by some procedure for testing the so-called subjective satisfaction, which can be done only by providing a suitable machinery for examining the grounds on which the order of detention is made and considering the representations of the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 6 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 persons detained in relation to those grounds. Per KANIA C. J., MAHAJAN and DAS JJ.---Section 7 of the said Act is not invalid merely because it does not provide for an oral hearing or an opportunity to lead evidence but only gives right to make a representation. Right to an oral hearing and right to give evidence are not necessarily implied in the right to make a representation given by Art. 22. Per KANIA C.J., and MAHAJAN J.--The provision contained in Sec. 11 that a person may be detained for such period as the 12-A 92 State thinks fit does not contravene Art. 22 (7) and it is not therefore invalid. Per KANIA. C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ. (FAZL ALI and MAHAJAN JJ. dissenting).--Article 22 (7) means that Parliament may prescribe either the circumstances under which, or the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months without reference to an advisory board. It is not necessary that the Parliament should prescribe both. The matters referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of sub-see. (1) of Sec. 12 constitute a sufficient description of such circumstances or classes of cases and Section 12 is not therefore open to the objection that it does not comply with Art. 22 (7) DAS J.--Parliament has in act and substance prescribed both in clauses (a) and (b) of sub-sec. (1) of Sec. 12. FAZL ALI and MAJAN JJ.--Article 22 (7) Means that both the circumstances and the class or classes of cases (which are two different expressions with different meanings and connotations) should be prescribed, and the prescription of one without the other will not be enough. The enumeration of the subjects for reasons connected with which a law of preventive detention could be made contained in els. (a) and (b) of sub-see. (1) of Sec.12 does not amount to prescribing the circumstances under which, or the class or classes of cases in which, a person can be detained for more than three months. Per KANIA C.J.--While it is not proper to take into consideration the individual opinions of members of Parlia- ment or Convention to construe the meaning of a particular clause, when a question is raised whether a certain phrase or expression was up for consideration at all or not, a reference to the debates may be permitted. PATANJAYLI SASTRI J.--In construing the provisions of an Act, speeches made in the course of the debates on the bill should not be taken into consideration. MUKHERJEA J.--In construing the Constitution it is better to leave out of account the debates in the Constituent Assembly, but a higher value may be placed on the report of the Drafting Committee.

K. Rajah Aiyar, Advocate-General of Madras (C. R. Pattabi Raman and R. Ganapathi, with him) lot the State of Madras. M.C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India (Jindralal, with him) for the Union of India. 1950. May 19. The following Judgments were delivered. KANIA C. J--This is a petition by the applicant under article 32 (1) of the Constitution of India for a writ of habeas corpus against his detention in the Madras Jail. In the petition he has given various dates showing how he has been under detention since December, 1947. Under the ordi- nary Criminal Law he was sentenced to terms of imprisonment but those convictions were set aside. While he was tires under detention under one of the orders of the Madras State Government, on the 1st of March, 1950, he was served with an order made under section 3 (1) of the Preventive Detention Act, IV of 1950. He challenges the legality of the order as it is contended that Act IV of 1950 contravenes the provisions of articles 13, 19 and 21 and the provisions of that Act are not in accordance with article 22 of the Con- stitution. He has also challenged the validity of the order on the ground that it is issued mala fide. The burden of proving that allegation is on the applicant. Because of the penal provisions of section 14 of the impugned Act the applicant has not disclosed the grounds, supplied to him, for his detention and the question of mala fides of the order therefore cannot be gone into under this petition. The question of the validity of Act IV of 1950 was argued before us at great length. This is the first case in which the different articles of the Constitution of India contained in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights has come for discussion before us. The Court is indebted to the learned counsel for the applicant and the Attorney-General for their assistance in interpreting the true meaning of the relevant clauses of the Constitution. In order to appreciate the rival contentions it is useful first to bear in mind the general scheme of the Constitution. Under article 53 of the Constitution the executive power of the Union is vested in the President and is to be exercised by him in accordance with the Constitution either directly or through officers subordinate to him. The legislative powers of the Union are divided between the Parliament and Legislatures of the States. The ambit and limitations on their respective powers are found in article 246 read with article 245, Schedule VII, Lists 1,2 and 3 of the Constitution. For the Union of India the Supreme Court is established and its powers and jurisdiction are set out in articles 124 to 147. This follows the pat- tern of the Government of India Act, 1935, which was the previous Constitution of the Government of India. Unlike the American Constitution, there is no article vesting the judicial power of the Union of India in the Supreme Court. The material points substantially altering the edifice are first in the Preamble which declares india a Sovereign Democratic Republic to secure to all its citizens justice, liberty and equality Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 10 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 and to promote among them all, frater- nity. Part III of the Constitution is an important innova- tion. It is headed ""Fundamental Rights."" In that Part the word ""State"" includes both the Government of the Union and the Government of the States. By article 13 it is expressly provided that all laws in force in the territory of India, immediately before the commencement of the Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, to the extent of such inconsistency, are void. There- fore, all laws in operation in India on the day the Consti- tution came into force, unless otherwise saved, to the extent they are inconsistent with this Chapter on Fundamen- tal Rights, become automatically void. Under article 13 (2) provision is made for legislation after the Constitution comes into operation. It is there provided that the State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contraven- tion of this clause shall to the extent of the contraven- tion, be void. Therefore, as regards future legislation also the Fundamental Rights in Part III have to be respected and, unless otherwise saved by the provisions of the Consti- tution, they will be void to the extent they contravene the provisions of Part III. Under article 245 (1) the legisla- tive powers conferred under article 246 are also made ""subject to the provisions of this Constitution,"" which of course includes Part III dealing with the Fundamental Rights. The term law in article 13, is expressed to be wide enough to include Acts, Ordinances, Orders, Bye-laws, Rules, Regulations and even custom or usage having, in the territory of India, the force of law. The rest of this Part is divided in seven divisions. ""Right to Equality"" is found in articles 14-18, ""Eight to Freedom"" in articles 19-22, ""Right against Exploitation"" in articles 23 and 24, ""Right to Freedom of Religion"" in articles 25-28, ""Cultural and Educational Rights"" in articles 29 and 30, ""Right to Property"" in article 31 and ""Right to Constitu- tional Remedies"" in articles 32-35. In this case we are directly concerned only with the articles under the caption ""Right to Freedom"" (19-22) and article 32 which gives a remedy to enforce, the rights conferred by this Part. The rest of the articles may have to be referred to only to assist in the interpretation of the above-mentioned arti- cles. It is obvious that by the insertion of this Part the powers of the Legislature and the Executive, both of the Union and the States, are further curtailed and the right to enforce the Fundamental Rights found in Part III by a direct application to the Supreme Court is removed from the legislative control. The wording of article 32 shows that the Supreme Court can be moved to grant a suitable relief, mentioned in article 32 (2), only in respect of the Funda- mental Rights mentioned in Part III of the Constitution. The petitioner is detained under a preventive detention order, made under Act IV of 1950, which has been passed by the Parliament of India. In the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, List I contains entries specifying items in respect of which the Parliament has exclusive legislative powers. Entry 9 is in these terms: ""preventive detention for reasons connected with Defence, Foreign Affairs or the Security of India; persons subjected to such detention."" Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 11 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 List III of that Schedule enumerates topics on which both the Union and the States have concurrent legislative powers. Entry 3 of that List is in these terms: ""Preventive detention for reasons connected with the security of a State, the maintenance of public order or the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community; persons subjected to such detention."" It is not disputed that Act IV of 1950 is covered by these two Entries in List I and List III of the Seventh Schedule. The contention of the peti- tioner is that the impugned legislation abridges or in- fringes the rights given by articles 19-21 and is also not in accordance with the permissive legislation on preventive detention allowed under articles 22 (4) and (7) and in particular is an infringement of the provisions of article 22 (5). It is therefore necessary to consider in detail each of these articles and the arguments advanced in respect thereof. Article 19 is for the protection of certain rights of freedom to citizens. It runs as follows :-- ""19. (1)--All citizens shall have the right-(a) to free- dom of speech and expression; (b) to assemble peaceably and without arms; (c) to form associations or unions; (d) to move freely throughout the territory of India; (e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India; (f) to acquire, hold and dispose of property; and (g) to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. ""(2) Nothing in sub-clause (a) of clause (1) shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it relates to, or prevent the State from making any law relat- ing to, libel, slander, defamation, contempt of court or any matter which offends against decency or morality or which undermines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State. (3) Nothing in sub-clause (b) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposts, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, in the interests of public order reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right con- ferred by the said sub-clause. (4) Nothing in sub-clause (c) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, in the interests of public order or morality, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub-clause. (5) Nothing in sub-clauses (d), (e) and (f) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub-clauses either in the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 12 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe. (6) Nothing in sub-clause (g) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, in the interests of the general public, reasonable restric- tions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub-clause, and, in particular, nothing in the said sub- clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it prescribes or empowers any authority to prescribe, or prevent the State from making any law prescribing or empowering any authority to prescribe, the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any pro- fession or carrying on any occupation, trade or business."" Clause (2) specifies the limits up to which the abridge- ment- of the right contained in 19 (1) (a) may be permitted. it is an exception. Similarly clause (3) sets out the limit of abridgement of the right in 19 (1) (b) and clause (4) specifies such limits in respect of the right in 19 (1) (c). Clause (5) is in respect of the rights mentioned in 19 (1) (d), (e) and (f) and clause (6) is in respect of the rights contained in 19 (1) (g). It cannot be disputed that the articles collected under the caption ""Right to Freedom"" have to be considered together to appreciate the extent of the Fundamental Rights. In the first place it is necessary to notice that there is a distinction between rights given to citizens and persons. This is clear on a perusal of the provisions of article 19 on the one hand and articles 20, 21 and 22 on the other. In order to determine whether a right is abridged or infringed it is first necessary to determine the extent of the right given by the articles and the limitations pre- scribed in the articles themselves permitting its curtail- ment. The inclusion of article 13 (1) and (2) in the Con- stitution appears to be a matter of abundant caution. Even in their absence, if any of the fundamental rights was infiringed by any legislative enactment, the Court has always the power to declare the enactment, to the extent it transgresses the limits, invalid. The existence of article 13 (1) and (2) in the Constitution therefore is not material for the decision of the question what fundamental right is given and to what extent it is permitted to be abridged by the Constitution itself. As the preventive detention order results in the deten- tion of the applicant in a cell it was contended on his behalf that the rights specified in article 19 (1) (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g) have been infringed. It was argued that because of his detention he cannot have a free right to speech as and where he desired and the same argument was urged in respect of the rest of the rights mentioned in sub-clauses (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g). Although this argu- ment is advanced in a case which deals with preventive detention, if correct, it-should be applicable in the case of punitive detention also to any one sentenced to a term of imprisonment under the relevant section of the Indian Penal Code. So considered, the argument must clearly be rejected. In spite of the saving clauses (2)to(6) permitting abridge- ment of the rights connected with each of them, punitive detention under several sections of the Penal Code, e.g., for theft, cheating, forgery and even ordinary assault, will be illegal. 'Unless such conclusion necessarily follows from the article, it is obvious that such construction should be avoided. In my opinion, such result is clearly not the outcome of the Constitution. The article has to be read without any pre-conceived notions. So read, it clearly means that the legislation to be examined must be directly in respect of one of the rights mentioned in the subclauses. If there is a legislation directly attempting to control a citizen's Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 13 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 freedom of speech or expression, or his right to assemble peaceably and without arms, etc., the question whether that legislation is saved by the relevant saving clause of article 19 will arise. If, however, the legisla- tion is not directly in respect of any of these subjects, but as a result of the operation of other legislation, for instance, for punitive or preventive detention, his right under any of these subclauses is abridged, the question of the application of article 19 does not arise. The true approach is only to consider the directness of the legisla- tion and not what will be the result of the detention other- wise valid, on the mode of the detenue's life. On that short ground, in my opinion, this argument about the in- fringement of the rights mentioned in article 19 (1) gener- ally must fail. Any other construction put on the article, it seems to me. will be unreasonable. It was next urged that while this interpretation may meet the contention in respect of rights under article 19 (1) (a), (b), (c), (e) and (g), the right given by article 19 (1) (d) is left untouched. That sub-clause expressly gives the right ""to move freely throughout the territory of India."" It was argued that by the confinement of the peti- tioner under the preventive detention order his right to move freely throughout the territory of India is directly abridged and therefore the State must show that the im- pugned legislation imposes only reasonable restrictions on the exercise of that right in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Sched- uled Tribe, under article 19 (5). The Court is thus en- joined to inquire whether the restrictions imposed on the detained person are reasonable in the interests of the general public. Article 14 of the Constitution gives the right to equality in these terms: ""The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India."" It was argued that the words ""within the territory of India"" are unnecessary in that article because the Parlia- ment is supreme to make laws operative only within the territory of India. Without those words also the article will bear the same meaning. Similarly, it was urged that the words ""territory of India"" in article 19 (1) (d) may be treated as superfluous, and preventive detention would thus be an abridgement of the right to move freely. In my opin- ion, this rule of construction itself is faulty. Because certain words may be considered superfluous (assuming them to be. so in article 14 for the present discussion) it is quite improper to assume that they are superfluous wherever found in the rest of the Constitution. On the contrary, in my opinion, reading sub-clause (d) as a whole the words ""territory of India"" are very important. What is sought to be protected by that sub-clause is the right to freedom of movement, i.e., without restriction, throughout the terri- tory of India. Read with their natural grammatical.. mean- ing the sub-clause only means that if restrictions are sought to be put upon movement of a citizen from State to State or even within a State such restrictions will have to be tested by the permissive limits prescribed in clause (5) of that Article. Sub-clause (d) has nothing to do with detention, preventive or punitive. The Constitution men- tions a right to freedom of movement throughout the territo- ry of India, Every word of that clause must be given its true and legitimate meaning and in the construction of a Statute, particularly a Constitution, it is improper. to omit any word which has a reasonable and proper place in it or to refrain from giving effect to its meaning. This position is made quite clear when clause (5) is read along with this sub-clause. It permits the imposition of reasona- ble. restrictions on the exercise of such right either in the interest of general public or the protection of the interest of any Scheduled Tribe. It is difficult to conceive of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 14 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 a reasonable restriction necessary in the interests of the general public for confining a person in a cell. Such restriction may be appropriate to prevent a person from going from one Province to another or one area to another, having regard to local conditions prevailing in particular areas. The point however is made abundantly clear by the alternative, viz., for the protec- tion of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe. What protec- tion of the interests of a Scheduled Tribe requires the confinement of a man in a cell ? On the other hand, pre- venting the movement of a person from one part of the terri- tory of India to another and the question of reasonable restriction imposed to protect the interests of a Scheduled Tribe is clearly intelligible and often noticed in the course of the administration of the country. Scheduled Tribes have certain rights, privileges and also disabili- ties. They have their own civilization, customs and mode of life and prevention of contact with persons or groups with a particular Scheduled Tribe may be considered undesirable during a certain time or in certain conditions. The legis- lative history of India shows that Scheduled Tribes have been given a separate place on these grounds. Reading article 19 as a whole, therefore, it seems to me that it has no application to a legislation dealing with preventive or punitive detention as its direct object. I may point out that the acceptance of the petitioner's argument on the interpretation of this clause will result in the Court being called upon to decide upon the reasonableness of several provisions of the Indian Penal Code and several other penal legislations as abridging this right. Even under clause (5), the Court is permitted to apply the test of reasonable- ness of the restrictions or limits not generally, but only to the extent they are either in the interests of the gener- al public, e.g., in case of an epidemic, riot, etc., or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe. In my opinion, this is not the intention of the Constitution. Therefore the contention urged in respect of article 19 fails. It was argued that article 19 and article 21 should be read together as implementing each other. Article 19 gave substantive rights to citizens while article 21 prescribed that no person can be deprived of his life and personal liberty except by procedure established by law. Even so, on a true construction of article 19, it seems to me that both preventive and punitive detention are outside the scope of article 19. In order to appreciate the true scope of article 19 it is useful to read it by itself and then to consider how far the other articles in Part HI affect or control its meaning. It is the first article under the caption ""Right to Freedom ."" It gives the rights mentioned in 19 (1) (a) to (g) to all citizens of India. These rights read by them- selves and apart from the controls found in clauses (2) to (6) of the same article, specify the different general rights which a free citizen in a democratic country ordi- narily has. Having specified those rights, each of them is considered separately from the point of view of a similar right in the other citizens, and also after taking into consideration the principle that individual liberty must give way, to the extent it is necessary, when the good or safety of the people generally is concerned. Thus the right to freedom of speech and expression is given by 19 (1) (a). But clause (2) provides that such right shall not prevent the operation of a law which relates to libel, slander, defamation, contempt of Court or any matter which offends against decency or morality or which undermines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State. Clause (2) thus only emphasizes that while the individual citizen has a free right of speech or expression, he cannot be permit- ted to use the same to the detriment of a similar right in another citizen or to the detriment of the State. Thus, all laws of libel, slander, contempt of Court or laws in respect of matters which offend against decency or morality are reaffirmed to be Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 15 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 operative in spite of this individual right of the citizen to freedom of speech and expression. Simi- larly; that right is also subject to laws which prevent undermining the security of the State or against activities which tend to overthrow the State. A similar analysis of clauses f3) and (4) shows similar restrictions imposed on similar grounds. In the same way clause (5) also permits reasonable restrictions in the exercise of the right to freedom of movement throughout the territory of India, the right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India or the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property, being imposed by law provided such reasonable restrictions on the exercise of such right are in the inter- est of the general' public. The Constitution further pro- vides by the same clause that similar reasonable restric- tions could be put on the exercise of those rights for the protection of the interest of a Scheduled Tribe. This is obviously to prevent an argument being advanced that while such restriction could be put in the interest of general public, the Constitution did not provide for the imposi- tion of such restriction to protect the interests of a smaller group of people only. Reading article 19 in that way as a whole the only concept appears to be that the specified rights of a free citizen arc thus controlled by what the framers of the Constitution thought were necessary restric- tions in the interest of the rest of the citizens. Reading article 19 in that way it appears to me that the concept of the right to move freely throughout the territo- ry of India is an entirely different concept from the right to ""personal liberty"" contemplated by article 21. ""Person- al liberty"" covers many more rights in one sense and has a restricted meaning in another sense. For instance, while the right to move or reside may be covered by the expression ,'personal liberty"" the right to freedom of speech (men- tioned in article 19 (1) (a)) or the right to acquire, hold or dispose of property (mentioned in 19 (1) (f)) cannot be considered a part of the personal liberty of a citizen. They form part of the liberty of a citizen but the limita- tion imposed by the word ""personal""leads me to believe that those rights are not covered by the expression personal liberty. So read there is no conflict between articles 19 and 21. The contents and subject matters of articles 19 and 21 are thus not the same and they proceed to deal with the rights covered by their respective words from totally different angles. As already mentioned in respect of each of the rights specified in sub-clauses of article 19 (1) specific limitations in respect of each is provided, while the expression ""personal liberty"" in article 21 is generally controlled by the gener- al expression ""procedure established by law."" The Constitu- tion, in article 19, and also in other articles in Part III, thus attempts to strike a balance between individ- ual liberty and the general interest of the society. The restraints provided by the Constitution on the legislative powers or the executive authority of the State thus operate as guarantees of life and personal liberty of the individu- als. Deprivation (total loss) of personal liberty, which inter alia includes the right to eat or sleep when one likes or to work or not to work as and when one pleases and sever- al such rights sought to be protected by the expression ""personal liberty"" in article 21, is quite different from restriction (which is only a partial control) of the right to move freely (which is relatively a minor right of a citizen) as safeguarded by article 19 (1) (d). Deprivation of personal liberty has not the same meaning as restriction of free movement in the territory of India. This is made clear when the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code in Chapter VIII relating to security of peace or maintenance of public order are read. Therefore article 19 (5) cannot apply to a substantive law depriving a citizen of personal liberty. I am unable to accept the contention that the word ""deprivation"" includes within its scope ""restriction"" when interpreting article 21. Article 22 envisages the law of preventive detention. So does article 9.46 read with Schedule Seven, List I, Entry 9, and List III, Entry 3. Therefore, when Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 16 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 the subject of preventive detention is specifically dealt with in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights I do not think it is proper to consider a legisla- tion ' permitting preventive detention as in conflict with the rights mentioned in article 19 (1). Article 19 (1) does not purport to cover all aspects of liberty or of personal liberty. In that article only certain phases of liberty are dealt with. ""Personal liberty"" would primarily mean liberty of the physical body. The rights given under article 19 (1) do not directly come under that description. They are rights which accompany the freedom or liberty of the person. By their very nature they are freedoms of a person assumed to be in full possession of his personal liberty. If article 19 is considered to be the only article safeguarding personal liberty several well-recognised rights, as for instance, the right to eat or drink, the right to work, play, swim and numerous other rights and activities and even the right to life will not be deemed protected under the Constitution. I do not think that is the intention. It seems to me improper to read article 19 as dealing with the same subject as article 21. Article 19 gives the rights specified therein only to the citizens of India while arti- cle 21 is applicable to all persons. The word citizen is expressly defined in the Constitution to indicate only a certain section of the inhabitants of India. Moreover, the protection given by article 21 is very general. It is of ""law""--whatever that expression is interpreted to mean. The legislative restrictions on the law-making powers of the legislature are not here prescribed in detail as in the case of the rights specified in article 19. In my opinion there- fore article should be read as a separate complete article. Article 21 which is also in Part III under the caption ""Right to Freedom"" runs as follows :- ""No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law."" This article has been strongly relied upon by the peti- tioner in support of his contention that the impugned Act is ultra vires the Parliament as it abridges the right given by this article to every person. It was argued that under the Constitution of the United States of America the corre- sponding provision is found in the 5th and 14th Amendments where the provision, inter alia, is ""that no person shall be deprived of his life or liberty or property except by due process of law."" It was contended for the petitioner that the Indian Constitution gives the same protection to every person in India, except that in the 'United States ""due process of law"" has been .construed by its Supreme Court to cover both substantive and procedural law, while in India only the protection of procedural law is guaranteed. It was contend- ed that the omission of the word ""due"" made no difference to the interpretation of the words in article 21. The word ""established""' was not equivalent to ""prescribed"". It had a wider meaning. The word ""law"" did not mean enacted law because that will be no 'legislative protection at all. If so construed, any Act passed by the Parliament or the State Legislature, which was otherwise within its legislative power, can destroy or abridge this right. On the same line of reasoning, it was argued that if that was the inten- tion there was no necessity to put this as a fundamental right in Part III at all. As to the meaning of the word ""law"" it was argued that it meant principles of natural justice. It meant ""jus"", i.e., law in the abstract sense of the principles of natural justice, as mentioned in standard works of Jurisprudence, and not ""lex"", i.e., enact- ed law. Against the contention that such construction will leave the meaning vague, it was argued that four principles of natural justice recognised in all civilized countries were covered, in any event, by the word ""law"". They are: Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 17 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 (1) An objective test, i.e., a certain, definite and ascer- tainable rule of human conduct for the violation of which one can be detained; (2) Notice of the grounds of such detention; (3) An impartial tribunal, administrative, judi- cial or advisory, to decide whether the detention is justi- fied; and (4) Orderly course of procedure, including an opportunity to be heard orally (not merely by making a written representation) with a right to lead evidence and call witnesses. In my opinion, this line of approach is not proper and indeed is misleading. As regards the American Constitution its general structure is noticed in these words in ""The Government of the United States"" by Munro (5th Edition) at page 53: ""The architects of 1787 built only the basement. Their descendants have kept adding walls and windows, wings and gables, pillars and porches to make a rambling structure which is not yet finished. Or, to change the metaphor, it has a fabric which, to use the words of James Russell Lowell, is still being 'woven on the roaring loom of time'. That is what the framers of the original Constitution intended it to be. Never was it in their mind to work out a final scheme for the government of the country and stereotype it for all time. They sought merely to pro- vide a starting point."" The same aspect is emphasized in Professor Willis's book on Constitutional Law and Cooley's Constitutional Limitations. In contrast to the American Constitution, the Indian Constitution is a very detailed one. The Constitution itself provides in minute details the legislative powers of the Parliament and the State Legisla- tures. The same feature is noticeable in the case of the judiciary, finance, trade, commerce and services. It is thus quite detailed and the whole of it has to be read with the same sanctity, without giving undue weight to Part III or article 246, except to the extent one is legitimately and clearly limited by the other. Four marked points of distinction between the clause in the American Constitution and article 21 of the Constitution of India may be noticed at this stage. The first is that in U.S A. Constitution the word ""liberty"" is used simpliciter while in India it is restricted to personal liberty. (2) In U.S.A. Constitution the same protection is given to proper- ty, while in India the fundamental right in respect of property is contained in article 31. (3) The word ""due"" is omitted altogether and the expression ""due process of law"" is not used deliberately. (4) The word ""established"" is used and is limited to ""Procedure"" in Our article 21. The whole argument of the petitioner is rounded on the meaning of the word ""law"" given to it by the Supreme Court of America. It seems unnecessary to embark on a discussion of the powers and jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the 'U.S.A. and how they came to enlarge or abridge the meaning of law in the expression ""due process of law"". Without going into details, I think there is no justification to adopt the meaning of the word ""law"" as interpreted by the Supreme Court of U.S.A. in the expression ""due process of law"" merely because the word ""law"" is used in article 21. The discussion of the meaning of ""due process of law"" found in Willis on Constitutional Law and in Coo- ley's Constitutional Limitations shows the diverse meanings given to that expression at different times and under dif- ferent circumstances by the Supreme Court of U.S.A., so much so that the conclusion reached by these authors is that the expression. means reasonable law according to the view of the majority of the judges of the Supreme Court at a particular time holding office. It also shows how the meaning of the expression was widened or abridged in certain decades. Moreover, to control the meaning so given to that expression from time to time the doctrine of police powers was brought into play. That doctrine, Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 18 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 shortly put, is that legislation meant for the good of the people generally, and in which the individual has to surrender his freedom to a certain extent because it is for the benefit of the people at large, has not to be tested by the touchstone of the ""due process of law"" formula. Our attention was drawn to the debates and report of the drafting committee of the Constituent Assembly in respect of the wording of this clause. The report may be read not to control the meaning of the article, but may be seen in case of ambiguity. In The Municipal Council of Sydney v. The Commonwealth(1), it was thought that individu- al opinion of members of the Convention expressed in the debate cannot be referred to for the purpose of construing the Constitution. The same opinion was expressed in United States v. Wong Kim Ark(2). The result appears to be that while it is not proper to take into consideration the indi- vidual opinions of Members of Parliament or Convention to construe the meaning of the particular clause, when a ques- tion is raised whether a certain phrase or expression was up for consideration at all or not, a reference to the debates may be' permitted. In the present case the debates were referred to to show that the expression ""due process of law"" was known to exist in the American Constitution (1) (1904) 1 Com. L.R. 208. (2) (169) U.S 649 at 699. and after a discussion was not adopted by the Constituent Assembly in our Constitution. In Administrator General of Bengal v. Premlal Mullick(1), a reference to the proceedings of the Legislature which resulted in the passing of the Act was not considered legitimate aid in the construction of a particular section. The same reasons were held as cogent for excluding a reference to such debates in construing an Indian Statute. Resort may be had to these sources with- great caution and only when latent ambiguities are to be resolved. See Craies' Statute Law (4th Edition) page 122, Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes (9th Edition)pp. 28- 29 and Crawford on Statutory Construction (1940 Edition) p. 379, article 214. A perusal of the report of the drafting committee to which our attention was drawn shows clearly that the Constituent Assembly had before it the American article and the expression ""due process of law"" but they deliberately dropped the use of that expression from our Constitution. No extrinsic aid is needed to interpret the words of article 21, which in my opinion, are not ambiguous.Normally read, and without thinking of other Constitutions, the expression ""procedure established by law"" must mean procedure prescribed by the law of the State. If the Indian Constitution wanted to preserve to every person the protection given by the due process clause of the Ameri- can Constitution there was nothing to prevent the Assembly from adopting the phrase, or if they wanted to limit the same to procedure only, to adopt that expression with only the word ""procedural"" prefixed to ""law."" However, the correct question is what is the right given by article 21 ? The only right is that no person shall be deprived of his life or liberty except according to procedure established by law. One may like that right to cover a larger area, but to give such a right is not the function of the Court; it is the function of the Constitution. To read the word ""law"" as meaning rules of natural justice will land one in (1) (1895)L.R. 221. A. 107. 15 difficulties because the rules of natural justice, as re- gards procedure, are nowhere defined and in my opinion the Constitution cannot be read as laying down a vague standard. This is particularly so when in omitting to adopt Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 19 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 ""due process of law"" it was considered that the expression ""procedure established by law"" made the standard specific. It can not be specific except by reading the expression as meaning procedure prescribed by the legislature. The word ""law"" as used in this Part has different shades of meaning but in no other article it appears to bear the indefinite meaning of natural justice. If so, there appears no reason why in this article it should receive this peculiar meaning. Article 31 which is also in Part III and relates to the fundamental rights in respect of property runs as follows :- ""No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law."" It is obvious that in that clause ""law"" must mean enact- ed law. The object of dealing with property under a differ- ent article appears more to provide the exceptions found in article 31 (2) to (6), rather than to give the word ""law"" a different meaning than the one given in article 21. The world ""established"" according to the Oxford Dictionary means ""to fix, settle, institute or ordain by enactment or agree- ment."" The word ""established"" itself suggests an agency which fixes the limits. According to the dictionary this agency can be either the legislature or an agreement between the parties. There is therefore no justification to give the meaning of ""jus"" to ""law"" in article 21. The phrase ""procedure established by law"" seems to be borrowed from article 31 of the Japanese Constitution. But other articles of that Constitution which expressly pre- serve other personal liberties in different clauses have to be read together to determine the meaning of ""law"" in the expression ""procedure established by law."" These articles of the Japanese Constitution have not been incorporated in the Constitution of India in the same language. It is not shown that the word ""law"" means ""jus"" in the Japanese Constitution. In the Japanese Constitution these rights claimed under the rules of natural justice are not given by the interpretation of the words ""procedure established by law"" in their article 31. The word ""due"" in the expression ""due process of law"" in the American Consti- tution is interpreted to mean ""just,"" according to the opinion of the Supreme Court of U.S.A. That word imparts jurisdiction to the Courts to pronounce what is ""due"" from otherwise, according to law. The deliberate omission of the word ""due"" from article 21 lends strength to the conten- tion that the justiciable aspect of ""law"", i.e., to consider whether it is reasonable or not by the Court, does not form part of the Indian Constitution. The omission of the word ""due"", the limitation imposed by the word ""procedure"" and the insertion of the word ""established"" thus brings out more clearly the idea of legislative prescription in the expres- sion used in article 21. By adopting the phrase ""procedure established by law"" the Constitution gave the legislature the final word to determine the law. Our attention was drawn to The King v. The Military Governor of the Hair Park Camp ('), where articles 6 and 70 of the Irish Constitution are discussed. Under article 6 it is provided that the liberty of the person is inviolable and no person shall be deprived of such except ""in accord- ance with law"" ......In article 70 it is provided that no one shall be tried ""save in due course of law"" and extraor- dinary Courts were not permitted to be established except the Military Courts to try military offences. The expres- sion ""in accordance with law"" was interpreted to mean not rules of natural justice but as the law in force at the time. The Irish Court gave the expression ""due course of law"" the meaning given to it according to the English law and not the American law. It was observed by Lord Atkin in Eshugbayi Eleko v. Officer Administering the Government of Nigeria C), that in accordance Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 20 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 with British Jurispru- dence no member of the executive can interfere with the liberty or property of a British subject except when he can support the legality of his act before a Court of justice. (1) [1924] 2 Irish Reports K.B. 104. (2) [1931] A.C. (62 at 670. In The King v. The Secretary of State for Home Affairs(1), Scrutton LJ. observed: ""A man undoubtedly guilty of murder must yet be released if due forms of law have not been followed in his conviction."" It seems very arguable that in the whole set-up of Part III of our Constitution these principles only remain guaranteed by article 21. A detailed discussion of the true limits of article 21 will not be necessary if article 22 is considered a code to the extent there are provisions therein for preventive detention. In this. connection it may be noticed that the articles in Part III deal with different and separate rights. Under the caption ""Right to Freedom"" articles 19--22 are grouped but each with a separate marginal note. It is obvious that article 22 (1) and (2) prescribe limita- tions on the right given by article 21. If the procedure mentioned in those articles is followed the arrest and detention contemplated by article 22 (1) and (2), although they infringe the personal liberty of the individual, will be legal, because that becomes the established legal proce- dure in respect of arrest and detention. Article 22 is for protection against arrest and detention in certain cases, and runs as follows :-- ""22. (1) No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice. (2.) Every person who is arrested and detained in custo- dy shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate. (3) Nothing in clauses (1) and (2) shall apply(a) to any person who for the time being is an enemy alien; or (1) (1923) 2 K.B. 361 at 382. (b) to any person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention. (4) No law providing for preventive detention shall authorize the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless- (a) an Advisory Board consisting of persons who are, or have been, or are qualified to be appointed as, Judges of a High Court, has reported before the expiration of the said period of three months that there is in its opinion suffi- cient cause for such detention: Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 21 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 Provided that nothing in this sub-clause shall authorise the detention of any person beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by Parliament under sub-clause (b) of clause 17); or (b) such person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by Parliament under subclauses (a) and (b) of clause (7). (5) When any person is detained in pursuance .of an order made under any law providing for preventive detention, the authority making the order shall, as soon as may be, communicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order. Nothing in clause (5) shall require the authority making any such order as is referred to in that clause to disclose facts which such authority considers to be against the public interest to disclose. (7) Parliament may by law prescribe- (a) the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preventive detention without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board in accordance with the provisions of sub- clause (a) of clause (4); (b) the maximum period for which any person may ,in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law provid- ing for preventive detention; and (c) the procedure to be followed by an Advisory Board in an inquiry under sub-clause (a) of clause (4)."" The learned Attorney-General contended that the subject of preventive detention does not fall under article 21 at all and is covered wholly by article 22. According to him, article 22 is a complete code. I am unable to accept that contention. It is obvious that in respect of arrest and detention article 22 (1) and (2) provide safeguards. These safeguards are excluded in the case of preventive detention by article 22 (3), but safe- guards in connection with such detention are provided by clauses (4) to (7) of the same article. It is therefore clear that article 21 has to be read as supplemented by article 22. Reading in that way the proper mode of construc- tion will be that to the extent the procedure is prescribed by article 22 the same is to be observed; otherwise article 21 will apply. But if certain procedural safeguards are expressly stated as not required, or specific rules on certain points of procedure are prescribed, it seems im- proper to interpret these points as not covered by article 22 and left open for consideration under article 21. To the extent the points are dealt with, and included or excluded,, article 22 is a complete code. On the points of procedure which expressly or by necessary implication are not dealt with by article 22, the operation of article Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 22 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 21 will remain unaffected. It is thus necessary first to look at article 22 (4) to (7) and next at the provisions 0 the impugned Act to determine if the Act or any of its provi- sions are ultra vires. It may be noticed that neither the American nor the Japanese Constitution contain provisions permitting preventive detention,. much less laying down limitations on such right of detention, in normal timeS, i.e., without a declaration of emergency. Preventive deten- tion in normal times,. i.e., without the existence of an emergency like war,. is recognised as a normal topic of legislation in List I. Entry 9, and List III, Entry 3, of the Seventh Schedule. Even in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights article 22 envisages legislation in respect of pre- ventive detention in normal times. The provisions of article 22 (4) to (7) by their very wording leave unaffected the large powers of legislation on this point and emphasize particularly by article 22 (7) the power of the Parliament to deprive a person of a right to have his case considered by an advisory board. Part III and. article 22 in particular are the only restrictions on that power and but for those provisions the power to legislate on this subject would have been quite unrestricted. Parliament could have made a law without any safeguard or any procedure for preventive detention. Such an autocratic supremacy of the legislature is certainly cut down by article 21. There- fore, if the legislature prescribes a procedure by a validly enacted law and such procedure in the case of preventive detention does not come in conflict with the express provi- sions of Part III or article 22 (4) to (7), the Preventive Detention Act must be held valid notwithstanding that the Court may not fully approve of the procedure prescribed under such Act. Article 22 (4) opens with a double negative. Put in a positive form it will mean that a law which provides for preventive detention for a period longer than three months shall contain .a provision establishing an advisory board, (consisting of persons with the qualifications mentioned in sub-clause (a)), and which has to report before the expira- tion of three months if in its opinion there was sufficient cause for such detention. This clause, if it stood by itself and without the remaining provisions of article 22, will apply both to the Parliament and the State Legislatures. The proviso to this clause further enjoins that even though the advisory board may be of the opinion that there was sufficient cause for such detention, i.e., detention beyond the period of three months, still the detention is not to be permitted beyond the maximum period, if any, prescribed by Parliament under article 22 (7) (b). Again the whole of this sub-clause is made inoperative by article 22 (4) (b) in respect of an Act of preventive detention passed by Parlia- ment under clauses (7) (a) .and (b). Inasmuch as the im- pugned Act is an Act of the Parliament purported to be so made, clause 22 (4) has no operation and may for the present discussion be kept aside. Article 22 prescribes that when any person under a preventive detention law is detained, the authority making the order shall, as soon as may be, commu- nicate to such person the grounds on which . the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order. This clause is of general operation in respect of every detention order made under any law permitting deten- tion. Article 22 (6) permits the authority making the order to withhold disclosure of facts which such authority consid- ers against the public interest to disclose. It may be noticed that this clause only permits the non-disclosure of facts, and reading clauses (5) and (6) together a distinc- tion is drawn between facts and grounds of detention. Article 22 (4) and (7) deal not with the period of detention only but with other requirements in the case of preventive detention also. They provide for the establishment of an advisory board, and the necessity of furnishing grounds to the detenue and also Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 23 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 to give him a right to make a represen- tation. Reading article 22 clauses (4) and (7) together it appears to be implied that preventive detention for less than three months, without an advisory board, is permitted under the Chapter on Fundamental Rights, provided such legislation is within the legislative competence of the Parliament or the State Legislature, as the case may be. Article 22 (5) permits the detained person to make a representation. The Constitution is silent as to the person to whom it has to be made, or how it has to be dealt with. But that is the procedure laid down by the Constitution. It does not therefore mean that if a law made by the Parliament in respect of preventive detention does not make provision on those two points it is invalid. Silence on these points does not make the impugned Act in contravention of the Constitution because the first question is what are the rights given by the Constitution in the case of preventive detention. The contention that the representation should be to an outside body has no support in law. Even in the Liversidge case the representation had to be made to the Secretary of State and not to another body. After such representation was made, another advisory board had to consider it, but it was not necessary to make the represen- tation itself to a third party. Article 22 (4) and (7) permit the non-establishment of an advisory board expressly in a parliamentary legislation- providing for preventive detention beyond three months. If so, how can it be urged that the nonestablishment of an advisory. board is a fundamental right violated by the procedure prescribed in the Act passed by the Parliament? The important clause to be considered is article 22 (7). Sub-clause (a) is important-for this case. In the case of an Act of preventive detention passed by the Parliament this clause contained in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights, thus permits detention beyond a period of three months and ex- cludes the necessity of consulting an advisory board, if the opening words of the sub-clause are complied with. Sub- clause (b) is permissive. It is not obligatory on the Parliament to prescribe any maximum period. It was argued that this gives the Parliament a right to allow a person to be detained indefinitely. If that construction is correct, it springs out of the words of sub-clause (7) itself and the Court cannot help in the matter. Subclause (c) permits the Parliament to lay down the procedure to be followed by the advisory board in an inquiry under sub-clause (a) of clause (4). I am unable to accept the contention that article 22 (4) (a) is the rule and article 22 (7) the exception. I read them as two alternatives provided by the Constitution for making laws on preventive detention. Bearing in mind the provisions of article 22 read with article 246 and Schedule VII, List I, Entry 9, and List III, Entry 3, it is thus clear that the Parliament is empowered to enact a law of preventive detention (a) for reasons connected with defence, (b) for reasons connected with foreign affairs, (c) for reasons connected with the security of India; and (under List III), (d) for reasons connected with the security of a State, (e) for reasons connected with the maintenance of public order, or (f) for reasons connect- ed with the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community. Counsel for the petitioner has challenged the validity of several provisions of the Act. In respect of the construction of a Constitution Lord Wright in James v. The Commonwealth of Australia(1), (1) (1936) A. 0. 578 at 614. observed that ""a Constitution must not be construed in any narrow and pedantic sense."" Mr. Justice Higgins in Attorney-General of New South Wales v. Brewery Employees' Union (1), observed: ""Although we are to interpret words of the Constitution on the same principles of interpretation as Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 24 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 we apply to any ordinary law, these very principles of interpretation compel us to take into account the nature and scope of the Act that we are interpreting--to remember that it is a Constitution, a mechanism under which laws are to be made and not a mere Act which declares what the law is to be."" In In re The Central Provinces and Berar Act XIV of 1938 (""'), Sir Maurice Gwyer C.J. after adopting these observations said: ""especially is this true of a Federal Constitution with its nice balance of jurisdictions. I conceive that a broad and liberal spirit should inspire those whose duty it is to interpret it; but I do not imply by this that they are free to stretch or pervert the lan- guage of the enactment in the interest of any legal or con- stitutional theory or even for the purpose of supplying omissions or of correcting supposed errors."" There is considerable authority for the statement that the Courts are not at liberty to declare an Act void because in their opinion it is opposed to a spirit supposed to pervade the Constitution but not expressed in words. Where the funda- mental law has not limited, either in terms or by necessary implication, the general powers conferred upon the Legisla- ture we cannot declare a limitation under the notion of hav- ing discovered something in the spirit of the Constitution which is not even mentioned in the instrument. It is diffi- cult upon any general principles to limit the omnipotence of the sovereign legislative power by judicial interposition, except so far as the express words of a written Constitution give that authority. It is also stated, if the words be positive and without ambiguity, there is no authority for a Court to vacate or repeal a Statute on that ground alone. But it is only in express constitutional provisions limiting legislative power and controlling the temporary will of a majority by a permanent and (1) (1908) 6 Com. L.R. 469 at 611-12. (2) (1939) F.C.R. 18 at 37. paramount law settled by the deliberate wisdom of the nation that one can find a safe and. solid ground for the authority of Courts of justice to declare void ,any legislative enact- ment. Any assumption of authority beyond this would be to place in the hands of the judiciary powers too great and too 'indefinite either for its own security. or the protection of private rights. It was first argued that by section 3 the Parliament had delegated its legislative power to the executive officer in detaining a person on his being satisfied of its necessi- ty. It was urged that the satisfaction must be of the legislative body. This contention of delegation of the legislative power in such cases has been considered and rejected in numerous cases by our Federal Court and by the English Courts. It is unnecessary to refer to all those cases. A reading of the various speeches in Liversidge v. Anderson clearly negatives this contention. Section 3 of the impugned Act is no delegation of legislative power to make laws. It only confers discretion on the officer to enforce the law made by the legislature. Section 3 is also impugned on the ground that it does not provide an objective standard which the Court can utilize for determining whether the requirements of law have been complied with. It is clear that no such objective standard of conduct can be pre- scribed, except as laying down conduct tending to achieve or to avoid a particular object. For preventive detention action must be taken on good suspicion. It is a subjective test based on the cumulative effect of different actions, perhaps spread over a considerable period. As observed by Lord Finlay in The King v. Halliday (2), a Court is the least appropriate tribunal to investigate the question whether circumstances of suspicion exist warranting the restraint on a person. The contention is urged in respect of preventive detention and not punitive detention. Before a person can be held liable for an offence it is obvious that he should be in a position to know what he may do or not do, and an omission to do or not to do will result in the State (1) (1942) A.C. 2C6. (2) (1917) A.C. 260 at 269. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 25 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 considering him guilty according to the penal enactment. When it comes however to preventive detention, the very purpose is to prevent the individual not merely from acting in a particular way but, as the sub-heads summarized above show, from achieving a particular object. It will not be humanly possible to tabulate exhaustively all actions which may lead to a particular object. It has therefore been considered that a punitive detention Act which sufficiently prescribes the objects which the legislature considers have not to be worked up to is. a sufficient standard to prevent the legislation being vague. In my opinion, therefore, the argument of the petitioner against section 3 of the impugned Act fails. It was also contended that section 3 prescribes no limit of time for detention and therefore the legislation is ultra vires. The answer is found in article 22 (7) (b). A perusal of the provisions of the impugned Act moreover shows that in section 12 provision is made for detention for a period longer than three months but not exceeding one year in respect of clauses (a) and (b) of that section. It appears therefore that in respect of the rest of the clauses mentioned in section 3 (1)(a)the detention is not contem- plated to be for a period longer than three months, and in such cases a reference to the advisory board under section 9 is contemplated. Section 7 of the Act which is next challenged, runs on the same lines as article 22 (5) and. (6) and in my opinion infringes no provision of the Constitution. It was argued that this gave only the right of making a representation without being heard 'orally or without affording an opportu- nity to lead evidence and therefore was not an orderly course of procedure, as required by the rules of natural justice. The Parliament by the Act has expressly given a right to the person detained under a preventive detention order to receive the grounds for detention and also has given him a right to make a representation. The Act has thus complied with the requirements of article 22 (s). That clause, which prescribes what procedure has to be followed as a matter of fundamental right, is silent about the person detained having a right to be heard orally or by a lawyer. The Constituent Assembly had before them the provisions of clause (1) of the same article. The Assembly having dealt with the requirements of receiving grounds and giving an opportunity to make a representation has deliberately refrained from providing a right to be heard orally. If so, I do not read the clause as guarantee- ing such right under article 22 (5). An ""orderly course of procedure"" is not limited to procedure which has been sanc- tioned by settled usage. New forms of procedure are as much, held even by the Supreme Court of America, due process of law as old forms, provided they give a person a fair opportunity to present his case. It was contended that the right to make a representation in article 22 (5) must carry with it a right to be heard by an independent tribunal; otherwise the making of a representation has no substance because it is not an effective remedy. I am unable to read clause (5) of .article 22 as giving a fundamental right to be heard by an independent tribunal. The Constitution deliberately stops at giving the right of representation. This is natural because under article 22 (7), in terms, the Constitution permits the making of a law by Parliament in which a reference to an advisory board may be omitted. To consider the right to make a representation as necessarily including a right to be heard by an independent judicial, administrative or advisory tribunal will thus be directly in conflict with the express words of article 22 (7). Even according to the Supreme Court of U.S.A. a right to a judicial trial is not absolute. In the United States v. Ju Toy (1), a question arose about the exclusion from entry into the States, of a Chinese who claimed to be a citizen of the United States. At page 263 the majority judgment con- tains the following passage :--"" If for the purpose of argument, we assume that the Fifth Amendment applies to him, and that to deny entrance to a citizen is to deprive him ,of liberty, we nevertheless Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 26 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 are of opinion that with regard to him due process of law does not require judicial trial: That is the result of the cases which we have cited, and the almost necessary result of the (1) (198) U.S. 253 at 263. power of the Congress to pass exclusion laws. That the decision may be entrusted to an executive officer, and that his decision is due process of law, was affirmed and ex- plained in several cases. It is unnecessary to repeat the often-quoted remarks of Mr. Justice Curtis, speaking for the whole Court, in Den Exden Murray v. Hoboken Land and Im- provement Company (1), to. show that the requirement of a judicial trial does not prevail in every case."" Again, I am not prepared to accept the' contention that a right to be heard orally is an essential right of proce- dure even according to the rules of natural justice. The right to make a defence may be admitted, but there is nothing to support the contention that an oral interview is compulsory. In the Local Government Board v. Arlidge (2), the respondent applied to the Board constituted under the Housing Act to state a special case for the opinion of the High Court, contending that the order was invalid because (1) the report of the Inspector had been treated as a confi- dential document and had not been disclosed to the respond- ent, and (2) because the Board had declined to give the respondent an opportunity of being heard orally by the person or persons by whom the appeal was finally decided. The Board rejected the application. Both the points were urged before the House of Lords on appeal. Viscount Haldane L.C. in his speech rejected the contention about the necessity of an oral hearing by observing ""But it does not follow that the procedure of every tribunal must be.the same. In the case of a Court of law tradition in this country has prescribed certain principles to which, in the main, the procedure must conform. But what that procedure is to be in detail must depend on the nature of a tribunal."" In rejecting the contention about the disclosure of the report of the Inspector, the Lord Chancellor stated: ""It might or might not have been useful to disclose this report, but I do not think that the Board was bound to do so. any more than it would have been bound to disclose all the minutes made on the papers in the office before (1) 18 HO.W. 272 at 280. (2) (1915) A.C. 120. a decision was come to ...... What appears to me to have been the fallacy of the judgment of the majority in the Court of appeal is that it begs the question at the begin- ning by setting up the test of the procedure of a Court of justice instead of the other standard which was laid down for such cases in Board of Education v. Rice (1). I do not think the Board was bound to hear the respondent orally provided it gave him the opportunities he actually had."" In spite of the fact that in England the Parliament is supreme I am unable to accept the view that the Parliament in making laws, legislates against the well-recognised principles of natural justice accepted as such in all civilized countries. The same view is accepted in the United States in Federal Communications Commission v. WJR The Goodwill Station (2). A right to lead evidence against facts suspected to exist is also not essential in the case of preventive deten- tion. Article 22 (6) permits the non-disclosure of facts. That is one of the clauses of the Constitution dealing with fundamental rights. If even the non-disclosure of facts is permitted, I fail to see how there can exist a right to contest facts by evidence and the noninclusion of such procedural right could make this Act invalid. Section 10 (3) was challenged on the ground that it excludes the right to appear in person or by any lawyer before the advisory board and it was argued that this was an infringement of a fundamental right. It must be noticed that article 22 (1) which gives a detained person a right to consult or be defended by his own legal practitioner is specifically excluded by article 22 (3) in the case of legislation dealing with preventive detention. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 27 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 Moreover,. the Parliament is expressly given power under article 22 (7) (c) to lay down the procedure in an inquiry by an advisory board. This is also a part of article 22 itself. If so, how can the omission to give a right to audience be considered -against the constitutional rights ? It was pointed out that section 10 (3) prevents even the disclosure of a (1) (1911) A.C. 179. (2) 337 U.S. 265 at 276. portion of the report and opinion of the advisory board.. It was argued that if so how can the detained person put forth his case before a Court and challenge the conclusions ? This argument was similarly advanced in Local Government Board v. Arlidge (1) and rejected, as mentioned above. In my opinion, the answer is in the provision found in article 22 (7) (c) of the Constitution of India. It was argued that section 11 of the impugned Act was invalid as it permitted the continuance of the detention for such period as the Central Government or the State Govern- ment thought fit. This may mean an indefinite period. In my opinion this argument has nos substance because the Act has to be read as a whole., The whole life of the Act is for a year and therefore the argument that the detention may be for an indefinite period is unsound. Again, by virtue of article 22 (7)(b), the Parliament is not obliged to fix the maximum term of such detention. It has not so fixed it, except under section 12, and therefore it cannot be stated that section 11 is in contravention of article 22 (7). Section 12 of the impugned Act is challenged on the ground that it does not conform to the provisions of article 22 (7). It is argued that article 22 (7) permits preventive detention beyond three months, when the Parliament pre- scribes ""the circumstances in which, and the class or class- es of cases in which,"" a person may be detained. It was argued that both these conditions must be fulfilled. In my opinion, this argument is unsound, because the words used in article 22 (7) themselves are against such interpretation. The use of the word ""which"" twice in the first part of the sub-clause, read with the comma put after each, shows that the legislature wanted these to be read as disjunctive and not conjunctive. Such argument might have been possible (though not necessarily accepted) if' the article in the Constitution was ""the circumstances. and the class or class- es of cases in which ...... ""I have. no doubt that by the clause, as worded, the legislature- (1) (1915) A.C. 120. intended that the power of preventive detention beyond three months may be exercised either if the circumstances in which, or the class or classes of cases in which, a person is suspected or apprehended to be doing the objectionable things mentioned in the section. This contention therefore fails. It was next contended that by section 12 the Parliament had provided that a person might be detained for a period longer than three months but not exceeding one year from the date of his detention, without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board, with a view to prevent him from acting in any manner prejudicial to (a) the defence of India, rela- tions of India with foreign powers or the security of India; or (b)the security of a State or the maintenance of public order. It must be noticed that the contingency provided in section 3 (1) (a) (iii), viz., the maintenance of supplies and Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 28 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 services essential to the community is omitted in sec- tion 12. Relying on the wording of these two sub-sections in section 12, it was argued that in the impugned Act the wording of Schedule VII List I, Entry 9, and List III, Entry 3, except the last part, are only copied. This did not comply with the requirement to specify either the circum- stances or the class or classes of cases as is necessary to be done under article 22 (7) of the Constitution. Circum- stances ordinarily mean events or situation extraneous to the actions of the individual concerned, while a class of cases mean determinable groups based on the actions of the individuals with a common aim or idea. Determinable may be according to the nature of the object also. It is obvious that the classification can be by grouping the activities of people or by specifying the objectives to be attained or avoided. The argument advanced on behalf of the petitioner on this point does not' appeal to me because it assumes that the words of Schedule VII List I, Entry 9, and List III, Entry 3 are never capable of being considered as circum- stances or classes of cases. In my opinion, that assumption is not justified, particularly when we have to take into consideration cases of preventive detention and not of conviction and punitive detention. Each of the expressions used in those entries is capable of complying with the requirement of mentioning circumstances or classes of cases. The classification of cases, having regard to an object, may itself amount to a description of the circumstances. It is not disputed that each of the entries in the Legislative Lists in the Seventh Schedule has a specific connotation well understood and ascertainable in law. If so, there appears no reason why the same expression when used in section 12 (1) (a) and (b) of the impugned Act should not be held to have such specific meaning and thus comply with the requirement of prescribing circumstances or classes of cases. This argument therefore must be rejected. Section 13(2) was attacked on the ground that even if a detention order was revoked, another detention order under section 3 might be made against the same person on the same grounds. This clause appears to be inserted to prevent a man being released if a detention order was held invalid on some technical ground. There is nothing in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights and in article 21 or 22 to prevent the inclusion of such a clause in a parliamentary legislation, permitting preventive detention. Article 20 (2) may be read as a contrast on this point. Dealing with the four fundamental principles of natural justice in procedure claimed by the petitioner, it is thus clear that in respect of preventive detention no question of an objective standard of human conduct can be laid down. It is conceded that no notice before detention can be claimed by the very nature of such detention. The argument that after detention intimation of the grounds should be given has been recognised in article 22 (5) and incorporated in the impugned Act. As regards an impartial tribunal, article 22 and (7) read together give the Parliament ample discretion. When in specified circumstances and classes of cases the preventive detention exceeds three months, the absence of an advisory board is expressly per- mitted by article 22 (7). Under article 22 (4) it appears implied that a provision for such tribunal is not necessary if the detention is for less than three months. As regards an opportunity to be heard, there is no absolute natural right recognised in respect of oral representation. It has been held to depend on the nature of the tribunal. The right to make a representation is affirmed by the Constitution in article 22 (5) and finds a place in the impugned Act. The right to an orderly course of procedure to the extent it is guaranteed by article 22 (4) read with article 22 (7) (c), and by article 22 (7) (a) and (b), has also been thus provided in the Act. It seems to me therefore that the petitioner's contentions even on these points fail. Section 14 was strongly attacked on the ground that it violated all principles of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 29 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 natural justice and even in- fringed the right given by article 22 (5) of the Constitu- tion. It runs as follows: ""14. (1) No Court shall, except for the purposes of a prosecution for an offence punishable under subsection (2), allow any statement to be made, or any evidence to be given, before it of the substance of any communication made under section 7 of the grounds on which a detention order has been made against any person or of any representation made by him against such order; and, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, no Court shall be entitled to require any public officer to produce before it, or to disclose the substance of, any such communication or representation made, or the proceedings of an Advisory Board or that part of the report of an Advisory Board which is confidential. (2) It shall be an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both, for any person to disclose or publish without the previous authorisation of the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, any contents or matter purporting to be contents of any such communication or representation as is referred to in sub-section (1): Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall apply to a disclosure made to his legal adviser by a person who is the subject of a detention order."" By that section the Court is prevented (except for the purpose of punishment for such disclosure) from being in- formed, either by a statement or by leading evidence, of the substance of the grounds conveyed to the detained person under section 7 on which the order was made, or of any representation made by him against such order. It also prevents the Court from calling upon any public officer to disclose the substance of those grounds or from the produc- tion of the proceedings or report of the.advisory board which may be declared confidential. It is clear that if this provision is permitted to stand the Court can have no material before it to determine whether the detention is proper or not. I do not mean whether the grounds are suffi- cient or not. It even prevents the Court from ascertaining whether the alleged grounds of detention have anything to do with the circumstances or class or classes of cases men- tioned in section 12 (1) (a) or (b). In Machindar Shivaji Mahar v. The King (1), the Federal Court. held that the Court can examine the grounds given by the Government to see if they are relevant to the object which the legislation has in view. The provisions of article 22 (5) do not exclude that right of the Court. Section 14 of the impugned Act appears to be a drastic provision. which re- quires considerable support to sustain it in a preventive detention Act. The learned Attorney-General urged that the whole object of the section was to prevent ventilation in public of the grounds and the representations, and that it was a rule of evidence only which the Parliament could prescribe. I do not agree. This argument is clearly not sustainable on the words of article 22 clauses (5) and (6). The Government has the right under article 22 (6)not to disclose facts which it considers undesirable to disclose in the public interest. It does not permit the Government to refrain from disclosing grounds which fall under clause (5). (1) [1949-50] F.C.R. 827. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 30 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 Therefore, it cannot successfully be contended that the disclosure of grounds may be withheld from the Court in public interest, as a rule of evidence. Moreover, the position is made clear by the words of article 22 (5). It provides that the detaining authority shall communicate to such detained person the grounds on which the order has been made. It is there fore ,essential that the grounds must be connected with the order of preventive detention. If they are not so .connected the requirements of article 22 (5) are not ,complied with and the detention order will be invalid. Therefore, it is open to a detained person to contend before a Court that the grounds on which the order' has been made have no connection at all with the order, or have no connec- tion with the circumstances or class or classes of cases under which a preventive detention order could be supported under section 12. To urge this argument the aggrieved party must have a right to intimate to the Court the grounds given for the alleged detention and the representation made by him. For instance, a person is served with a paper on which there are written three stanzas of a poem or three alphabets written in three different ways. For the validity of the detention order it is necessary that the grounds should be those on which the order has been made. If the detained person is not in a position to put before the Court this paper, the Court will be prevented from considering whether the requirements of article 22 (5) are complied with and that is a right which is guaranteed to every person. It seems to me therefore that the provisions .of section 14 abridge the right given under article 22 (5) and are there- fore ultra vires. It next remains to be considered how far the invalidity of this section affects the rest of the impugned Act. The impugned Act minus this section can remain unaffected. The omission of this section will not change the nature or the structure or the object of the legislation. Therefore the decision that section 14 is ultra vires does not affect the validity of the rest of the Act. In my opinion therefore Act IV of 1950, except .section 14, is not ultra vires. It does not infringe any provisions of Part III of the Constitution and the con- tention of the applicant against the validity of that Act except to the extent of section 14, fails. The petition therefore fails and is dismissed. FAZL ALI J.--The question to be decided in this case is whether 'the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 (Act IV of 1950), is wholly or in part invalid and whether the peti- tioner who has been detained under that Act is entitled to a writ in the nature of habeas corpus on the ground that his detention is illegal. The question being a pure question of law can he decided without referring to a long chain of facts which are narrated in the petitioner's application to this Court and which have a more direct bearing on the alleged mala fides of the authorities who have detained him than on the validity of the Act. The Act which is impugned was enacted by the Parliament on the 26th February, 1950, and will cease to have effect on the 1st April, 1951, save as respects. things done or omit- ted to be done before that date. The main provisions of the Act are set out in sections 7, 8, 9, 10,11, 12 and 14. Section a (1) provides that ""the Central Government or the State Government may- (a) if satisfied with respect to any person that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to- (i) the defence of India, the relations of India with foreign powers, or the security of India, or Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 31 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 (ii) the security of the State or the maintenance of public order, or (iii) the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community, or (b) if satisfied with respect to any person who is. a foreigner within the meaning of the Foreigners Act, 1946 (XXXI of 1946), that with a view to regulating his continued presence in India or with a view to making arrangements for his expulsion from India, it is necessary so to do, make an order directing that such person be detained."" Sub-sections (2) and (3) of this section empower a District Magistrate, Sub-Divisional Magistrate or the Com- missioner of Police in a Presidency Town to exercise the power conferred by and make the order contemplated in sub- section (1), but with the qualification that any order made thereunder must be reported forthwith to the Government of the State to which the .officer in question is subordinate with the grounds on which the order has been made and such other particulars as in his opinion have a bearing on the necessity for the order. Section 7 of the Act provides that the authority making an order of detention shall as soon as may be communicate to the person detained the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order, in a case where such ,order has been made by the Central Government, to that Government, and in a case where it has been made by a State Government or an officer subor- dinate thereto, to the State Government. Section 8 provides that the Central Government and each State Government shall, whenever necessary, constitute one or more advisory boards for the purposes of the Act, and state the qualifications of persons of which the board should consist. Section 9 pro- vides that when a detention order has been made with a view to preventing a person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community or if it is made in regard to a person who is a foreigner within the meaning of the Foreigners Act with a view to regulating his continued presence in India or making arrangements for his expulsion from India, the grounds on which the order has been made and the representation, if any,. of the person detained shall, within six weeks from the date of detention, be placed 'before an advisory regard. It will be noticed that this section does not provide that the cases of persons who are detained under section 3 (1) (a) (i) and (ii) will also be placed before the advisory board. Section 10 lays down the procedure to be followed by. the advisory board and section 11 provides that in any case where the advisory board has reported that there is sufficient cause for the detention of the person concerned, the detention order may be confirmed and the detention of the person concerned may be continued for such period as the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, thinks fit. Section 12,. which is a very important section, as we shall presently see, runs as follows :-- ""12 (1) Any person detained in any of the following classes of cases or under any of the following circumstances may be detained without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board for a period longer than three months, but not exceed- ing one year from the date of his detention, namely, where such person has been detained with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to- Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 32 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 (a) the defence of India, relations of India with foreign powers or the security of India; or (b) the security of a State or the maintenance of public order. (2) The case of every person detained under a detention order to which the provisions of sub-section (1) apply shall, within a period of six months from the date of his detention, be reviewed where the order was made by the Central Government or a State, Government, by such Govern- ment, and where the order was made by any officer specified in sub-section (2) of section 3, by the State Government to which such officer is subordinate, in consultation with a person who is or has been or is qualified to be appointed as Judge of a High Court nominated in that behalf by the Cen- tral Government or the State Government, as the case may be."" Section 14, which is also a material section for the purpose of this case, is to the following effect :-- ""(1) No Court shall, except for the purposes of' a prosecution for an offence punishable under subsection (2), allow any statement to be made, or any evidence to be given, before it of the substance of any communication made under section 7 of the grounds on which a detention order has been made against any person or of any representation made by him against such order; and, not- withstanding anything contained in any other law, no Court shall be entitled to require any public officer to produce before it, or to disclose the substance of, any such commu- nication or representation made, or the proceedings of an Advisory Board or that part of the report of an Advisory Board which is confidential. (2) It shall be an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both, for any person to disclose or publish without the previous authorisation of the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, any contents or matter purporting to be the contents of any such communication or representation as is referred to in sub-section (1): Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall apply to a disclosure made to his legal adviser by a person who is the subject of a detention order."" The point which has been pressed before us is that the Act is invalid, as it takes away or abridges certain funda- mental rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution of India, and in support of this general proposition, reliance is placed on article 13 (2) which runs as follows :- ""The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 33 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 the contravention, be void."" The rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution are classified under seven broad heads, as follows :-- (1) Right to equality; (2) Right to freedom; (3) Right against exploitation; (4) Right to freedom of religion; (5) Cultural and educational rights; (6) Right to property; and (7) Right to constitutional remedies. Most of the articles which are said to have been disre- garded occur under the heading ""Right to freedom,"" these articles being articles 19 (1) (d), 21 and 22. Another article which is also said to have been violated is article 32, under which the present application for a writ of habeas corpus purports to have been made. Article 19 (1)is divided into seven sub-clauses and runs as follows:- ""All citizens shall have the right- (a) to freedom of speech and expression; (b) to assemble peaceably and without arms; (c) to form associations or unions; (d) to move freely throughout the territory of India; (e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India; "" (f) to acquire, hold and dispose of property; and (g) to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business."" Clauses (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this article pro- vide that nothing in clause (1) shall affect the operation of any existing law in regard to the rights under that clause, under certain conditions which are mentioned there- in. Clause (5), with which we are directly concerned and which will serve as a specimen to show the nature of these provisions, is to the following effect :-- Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 34 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 ""Nothing in sub-clauses (d), (e) and (f)of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub-clauses either in the interests of the general public or for the protection 'of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe."" The contentions advanced on behalf of the petitioner with reference to this article are :--(1) that the Act under which he has been detained deprives him who is a citizen of the Republic of India of the right to move freely throughout the territory of India, which is guaran- teed under article 19 (1) (d), and (2) that under clause (5) of article 19, it is open to this Court to judge whether the restrictions imposed by the Act on the exercise of the right conferred by article 19 (1) (d) are reasonable or otherwise. Before dealing with this argument, it is necessary to understand the meaning of the words used in article 19 (1)(d) and to have a clear compre- hension as to the true nature of the right conferred there- under. The contention put forward on behalf of the peti- tioner is that freedom of movement is the essence of person- al liberty and any restraint on freedom of movement must be held to amount to abridgment or deprivation of personal liberty, as the case may be, according to the nature of the restraint. After very careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that this contention is well-founded in law. Blackstone in his ""Commentaries on the Laws of England"" (4th Edition, volume 1, page 134) states that ""personal liberty consists in the power of locomotion, of changing .'situation or moving one's person to whatsoever place one's own incli- nation may direct, without imprisonment or restraint unless by due course of law."" The authority of this state- ment has never been questioned, and it has been bodily incorporated by H.J. Stephen in his ""Commentaries on the Laws of England"" and has been reproduced by Cooley in his well-known treatise on ""Constitutional Limitations"" (8th Edition, volume 1, page 710), which was extensively quoted by both parties in the course of their arguments. The view that freedom of movement is the essence of personal liberty will also be confirmed by reference to any book on the criminal law of England dealing with the offence of false imprisonment or any commentary on the Indian Penal Code dealing with the offences of wrongful restraint or confine- ment. Russell in his book on ""Crimes and Misdemeanours"" (8th Edition, volume 1, page 861), dealing with the offence of false imprisonment states as follows :-- ""False imprisonment is unlawful and total restraint of the personal liberty of another, whether by constraining him or compelling him to go to a particular place or by confin- ing him in a prison or police station or private place, or by detaining him against his will in a public place ........... the essential element in the offence is the unlawful detention of the person or the unlawful restraint on his liberty. Such interference with the liberty of another's movements is unlawful, unless it may be justified ...... "" Again, Dr. Gour in dealing with the offence of wrongful restraint in his book on ""The Penal Law of British India"" (5th Edition, page 1144) observes as follows :-- Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 35 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 ""Following the principle that every man's person is sacred and that it is free, law visits with its penalties those who abridge his personal liberty, though he may have no design upon his person. But the fact that he controls its movements for ever so short a time is an offence against the King's peace, for no one has the right to molest another in his free movements."" Dealing with the offence of wrongful confinement, the same learned author observes as follows at page 1148 of his book :-- ""'Wrongful confinement' is a species of ' wrongful restraint' as defined in the last section. In wrongful restraint, there is only a partial suspension of one's liberty of locomotion, while in wrongful confinement there is a total suspension of liberty 'beyond certain circum- scribing limits'."" Both these authors speak of restraint on personal liber- ty and interference with the liberty of one's movements or suspension of liberty or locomotion as interchangeable terms. In Bird v. Jones (1), Coleridge J. said that ""it is one part of the definition of freedom to be able to go whithersoever one pleases."" A similar opinion has been expressed by several authors including Sir Alfred Denning in his book entitled ""Freedom under the Law."" There can there- fore be no doubt that freedom of movement is in the last analysis the essence of personal liberty, and just as a man's wealth is generally measured in this country in terms of rupees, annas and pies, one's personal liberty depends upon the extent of his freedom of movement. But it is contended on behalf of the State that freedom of move- (1) 7 Q.B. 742. ment to which reference has been made in article 19 (1) (d) is not the freedom of movement to which Blackstone and other authors have referred, but is a different species of freedom which is qualified by the words ""throughout the territory of India."" How the use of the expression ""throughout the territory of India"" can qualify the meaning of the rest of the words used in the article is a matter beyond my compre- hension. In my opinion, the words ""throughout the territory of India"" were used to stretch the ambit of the freedom of movement to the utmost extent to which it could be guaran- teed by our Constitution. The Constitution could not guar- antee freedom of movement outside the territorial limits of India, and so has used those words to show that a citizen was entitled to move from one corner of the country to another freely and without any obstruction. ""Throughout"" is an amplifying and not a limiting expression, and I am sur- prised to find that the expression ""throughout the territory of India,"" which was used to give the widest possible scope to the freedom of movement, is sought to be construed as an expression limiting the scope and nature of the freedom. In my opinion, the words ""throughout the territory of India,"" having regard to the context in which they have been used here, have the same force and meaning as the expression ""to whatsoever place one's own inclination may direct"" used by Blackstone, or the expression ""freedom to be ,able to go whithersoever one pleases"" used by Coleridge J. in Bird v. Jones (1). I am certain that neither of these authorities contemplated that the freedom of movement which is vouch- safed to a British citizen, is guaranteed beyond the terri- torial limits of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 36 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 British territories. The question as to whether preventive detention is an encroachment on the right guaranteed by article 19 (1) (d) has been considered by the Nagpur, Patna and Calcutta High Courts. The view which has .been ultimately adopted by these High Courts is that preventive detention is not a violation of the right guaranteed by article 19 (1) (d), but, in the Calcutta (1) 7 Q.B. 742. High Court, where the matter has been elaborately discussed, at least five Judges have held that it does, and in the ultimate analysis the number of Judges. who have held the contrary view appears to be the same. Having regard to the fact that the view expressed by so many learned Judges is opposed to the view I am inclined to take, I consider it necessary to deal briefly with the main objections which have been raised in support of the narrow meaning sought to be attached to the words in article 19 (1)(d). I have already dealt with one of them which is based on the ex- pression ""throughout the territory of India."" A. nd I shall now proceed to deal with the, others seriatim. I. It will be recalled that clause (5) of article 19, which I have already quoted in full, provides among other things that nothing in clause (1) (d) shall affect the operation of any law, present or future, imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right of freedom of movement either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe. It has been argued that the use of the words ""interests of any Scheduled Tribe"" in this clause shows that the right guaranteed by article 19 (1) (d) is a limited right of movement, such as the right to visit different localities and to go from one place to another and is different from the expression ""freedom of movement"" which has been stated by Blackstone to be another name for personal liberty. It is pointed out that the restrictions in contemplation here are mainly restrictions preventing undesirable outsiders from visiting Scheduled Areas and exploiting Scheduled Tribes, and if the words ""freedom of movement"" had been used in the larger sense, such a small matter would not have found a place in clause (5) of article 19.. I must frankly confess that I am unable to appreciate this argument and to hold that a mere reference to Scheduled Tribes affects the plain meaning of the words used in clause (1) (d) of article 19. The words used in article 19 (1) (d) are very wide and mean that a person can go at his will in any direction to any locality and to any distance. Re- straint on a freedom. so wide in scope and extent may assume a variety of forms and may include internment or externment of a person, his confinement to a particular locality or within the walls of a prison, his being prevented from visiting or staying in any particular area, etc. The framers of the Constitution wanted to save all restrictive legislation affecting freedom of movement made in the interests of the general public (which expression means the same thing as ""public interests"") and I think that the law in regard to preventive detention is fully covered by the expression ""restrictions imposed in the public interests."" But they also remembered that there were restrictive laws made in the interests of an important community and that similar laws may have to be made in future and hence they added the words ""for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe."" A reference to the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution and the corresponding provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935, as well as to certain laws made for Chota Nagpur, Santhai Pargangs and .other localities will Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 37 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 show that great importance has been attached in this country to. the protec- tion and preservation of the members of the scheduled tribes .and maintenance of order in tribal areas, and this, in my opinion, is sufficient to account for the special mention of the scheduled tribes in clause (5). It may, at first sight, appear to be a relatively small matter, but in their anxiety to cover the whole field of restrictive laws made whether in the public interest or in the interests of a particular community and not to leave the smallest loophole, the framers of the Constitution apparently decided to draft the clause in the present form. As far as I am aware, there are no restrictive laws made in the interests of any commu- nity other than the scheduled tribes, and I think clause (5)is sufficiently comprehensive to include the smallest as well as the most complete restrictions on freedom of move- ment. I am also satisfied that the mere mention of sched- uled tribes in clause (5) cannot change, the plain meaning of the words of the main provision which we find in article 19 (1) (d) and confine it to some kind of peculiar and truncated freedom of movement which is unconnected with personal liberty and which is unknown to any Constitution with which. we are familiar: It will perhaps be not out of place to refer in this. connection to Ordinance XIV of 1943, which is one of the ordinances by which the Defence of India Act, 1939, was partly amended. This ordinance provides for-- ""the apprehension and detention in custody of any person whom the authority empowered by the rules to appre- hend or detain as the case may be suspects, on grounds appearing to such authority-to be reasonable, of being of hostile origin, or of having acted, acting, being about to act, or being likely to act in a manner prejudicial to the public safety or interest, the defence of British India, the maintenance of public order, His Majesty's relations with foreign powers or Indian States, the maintenance of peaceful conditions in tribal areas or the efficient prosecution of the war, or with respect to whom such authority is satisfied that his apprehension and detention are necessary for the purpose of preventing him from acting in any such prejudi- cial manner, the prohibition of such person from entering or residing or remaining in any area, and the compelling of such person to reside and remain in any area, or to do or abstain from doing anything."" The points to be noted in connection with the ordinance are :-- (1) that it is an ordinance specifically providing for apprehension and detention; (2) that notwithstanding the fact that there is a gener- al reference in it to acts prejudicial to public safety or interests and maintenance of public order there is also a specific reference to maintenance of peaceful conditions in tribal areas; (3) that tribal areas and scheduled tribes are, kindred subjects as would appear from the Fifth Schedule appended to the Constitution; and (4) that maintenance of peaceful conditions in tribal areas may be as much in the public interest as in the inter- ests of persons living in those areas. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 38 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 This ordinance shows at least this much that sometimes the law of preventive detention can also be made in the interests of scheduled tribes or scheduled areas and conse- quently the mere mention of scheduled tribes in clause (5) does not necessarily exclude laws relating to preventive detention from the scope of article 19 (5) The same remarks apply to the ordinance called ""The Restriction and Detention Ordinance, 1944"" (Ordinance No. III of 1944) which empow- ered the Central Government or the Provincial Government to detain and make orders restricting the movements of certain persons in the interest of public safety, maintenance of public order as well as maintenance of peaceful conditions in tribal areas, etc. II. It is also argued that since preventive detention amounts to a total deprivation of freedom of movement, it is not a violation of the right granted under article 19 (1) (d) in regard to which the word ""restriction"" and not ""deprivation"" has been used in clause (5). This argument also does not appeal to me. There are really two questions which fall to be decided in this case, viz., (a) Does pre- ventive detention take away the right guaranteed by article 19 (1) (d)?; and (b) if so, what are the consequences, if any ? It seems obvious to me that preventive detention amounts to a complete deprivation of the right guaranteed by article (19) (d). The meaning of the word ""restriction"" is to be considered with reference to the second question and I think that it will be highly technical to argue that deprivation of a right cannot be said to involve restriction on the exercise of the right. In my opinion, having regard to the context in which the word ""restriction"" has been used, there is no antithesis between that word and the word ""depriva- tion."" As I have already stated, restraint on the right to move can assume a variety of forms and restriction would be the most appropriate expression to be' used in clause (5) so as to cover all those forms ranging from total to various kinds of partial deprivation freedom of movement. I will however have to advert to this subject later and will try to show that the construction I have suggested is supported by good authori- ty. III. It appears that some of the Judges who had to deal with the question which we have before us were greatly influenced by the argument that if the deprivation of per- sonal liberty amounts to deprivation of the right granted under article 19 (1) (d), any conviction for an offence under the Indian Penal Code involving a sentence of impris- onment will be subject to judicial review on the ground of reasonableness of the provisions of the Code under which the conviction is recorded. Meredith C.J. of the Patna High Court has given expression to his concern for the situation which will thereby arise, in these words :-- ""It will be seen that the claim made is very sweeping indeed. It would mean that every law under which a person may be imprisoned, including all the provisions of the Penal Code, is open to examination by the Courts on the ground of reasonableness. It makes the Courts supreme arbiters in regard to any such legislation, and they can reject it-or accept it in accordance with their ideas of whether it appeals to their reason. But ideas of reasonableness or otherwise are apt to vary widely. Take for example, laws relating to prohibition or take such a matter as adultery which the Indian law regards as a crime punishable with imprisonment but the English law does not. It is difficult to believe the framers of the Constitution ever intended to Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 39 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 place so enormous a power in the hands of the Courts ................""[Rattan Roy v. The State of Biharl. The obvious and strictly legal reply to this argument is that the consideration, which has so greatly weighed with the learned Chief Justice, is not enough to cut down the plain meaning of the general words used in article 19 (5) of the Constitution. As has been pointed out in a number of cases, ""in construing enacted words, we are not concerned with the policy involved or with the results injurious or otherwise which may follow by giving effect to the language -used"" [King Emperor v. Benoari Lal Sharma and others (1)I Apart from this aspect of the matter, I agree with one of the learned Judges Of the Calcutta High Court in his remark that ""no calamitous or untoward result will follow even if the provisions of the Penal Code become justiciable."" I am certain that no Court would interfere with a Code which has been the law of the land for nearly a century and the provisions of which are not in conflict with the basic principles of any system of law. It seems to me that this Court should not be deterred from giving effect to a fundamental right granted under the Constitution, merely because of a vague and unfounded fear that something catas- trophic may happen. I have so far proceeded on the assumption that the basis of the objection raised by Meredith C.J. is correct in law, but, in my opinion, it is not. Crime has been defined to consist in those acts or omissions involving breach of a duty to which a sanction is attached by law by way of pun- ishment or pecuniary penalty in the public interests. (See Russell's ""Crimes and Misdemeanours ""). Section 2 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, provides that ""every person shall be liable to punishment under this Code' and not otherwise for every act or omission contrary to the provisions there- of, of which he shall be guilty within British India ."" The Indian Penal Code does not primarily or necessarily impose restrictions on the freedom of movement, and it is not correct to say that it is a law imposing restrictions on the right to move freely. Its primary object is to punish crime and not to restrict movement. The punishment may consist in imprisonment or a pecuniary penalty. If it consists in a pecuniary, penalty, it obviously involves no restriction on movement; but if it consists in imprisonment, there is a restriction on movement. This restraint is imposed not under a law imposing restrictions on movement but under a law defining crime and making it punishable. The punishment is correlated directly with the violation of some other person's right and not with the right of (1) [1945] F.C.R. 161 at p. 177. movement possessed by the offender himself. In my opinion, therefore, the Indian Penal Code does not come within the ambit of the words ""law imposing restriction on the right to move freely "". In the course of the arguments, the expression ""punitive detention"" was frequently used and the tendency was to put it on the same footing as preventive detention for the purpose of certain arguments. Punitive detention is however essentially different from preventive detention. A person is punitively detained only after a trial for committing a crime and after his guilt has been established in a compe- tent Court of justice. A person so convicted can take his case to the State Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 40 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 High Court and sometimes bring it to this Court also; and he can in the course of the proceedings connected with his trial take all pleas available to him including the plea of want of jurisdiction of the Court of trial and the invalidity of the law under which he has been prosecuted. The final judgment in the criminal trial will thus constitute a serious obstacle in his way if he chooses to assert even after his conviction that his right under article 19 (1) (d) has been violated. But a person who is preventively detained has not to face such an obstacle whatever other obstacle may be in his way. IV. It was pointed out that article 19 being confined to citizens, the anomalous situation will follow that in cases of preventive detention, a citizen will be placed in a better position than a non-citizen, because if a citizen is detained his detention will be open to some kind of judicial review under article 19 (5), but if a non-citizen has been detained his case will not be open to such review. In this view, it is said that the whole Act relating to preventive detention, may be declared to be void if it is unreasonable, though it concerns citizens as well as persons other than citizens. I must frankly state that I am not at all per- turbed by this argument. It is a patent fact that the Constitution has confined all the rights mentioned in arti- cle 19 (1) to citizens. It is equally clear that restric- tions on those rights are to a limited extent at least open to judicial review- The very same question which is raised in regard to article 19 (1)(d) will arise with regard to most of the other sub-clauses. A citizen has the right to assemble peaceably and without arms, to form associations or unions and so on. If there is any law imposing unreason- able restrictions on any of these rights, that law will not be good law so far as citizens are concerned, but it may be good law so far as non-citizens are concerned. I do not see why a similar situation arising with regard to the right granted under sub-clause (d) should be stated to be anoma- lous. So far as the right of free movement is concerned, a non-citizen has been granted certain protections in articles 21 and 22. If a ,citizen has been granted certain other additional protections under article 19 (1) (d), there is no anomaly involved in the discrimination. I think that it is conceivable that a certain law may be declared to be void as against a citizen but not against a non-citizen. Such a result however should not affect our mind if it is found to have been clearly within the contemplation of the framers of the Constitution. V. It was contended that the rights declared by article 19 are the rights of a free citizen and if he has already been deprived of his liberty in the circumstances referred to in articles 20, 21 and 22, then it would be idle to say that he still enjoys the right referred to in article 19. After giving my fullest consideration to this argument, I have not been able to appreciate how it arises in this case. There is nothing in article 19 go suggest that it applies only to those cases which do not fall under articles 20, 21 and 22. Confining ourselves to preventive detention, it is enough to point out that a person who is preventively de- tained must have been, before he lost his liberty, a free man. Why can't he say to those who detained him: ""As a citizen I have the right to move freely and you cannot curtail or take away my right beyond the limits imposed by clause (5)of article 19."" This is the only question which arises in the case and it should not be obscured by any abstruse or metaphysical considerations. It is true that if you put a man under detention, he cannot move and therefore he is not in a position to exercise the right guaranteed under article 19 (1) (d). but this is only the physical aspect of the matter and a person who is bed-ridden on account of disease suffers from a similar disability. In law, however,. physical duress does not deprive a person of the right to freedom of movement. If he has been detained under some provision of law imposing restrictions on the freedom of movement, then the question will arise whether the restrictions are reasonable. If he has been detained under Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 41 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 no provision of law or under some law which is invalid, he must be set at liberty. To my mind, the scheme of the Chapter dealing with the fundamental rights does not contemplate what is attributed to it, namely, that each article is a code by itself and is independent of the others. In my opinion, it cannot be said that articles 19, 20, 21 and 22 do not to some extent over- lap each other. The case of a person who is convicted of an offence will come under articles 20 and 21 and also under article 221 so far as his arrest and detention in custody before trial are concerned. Preventive detention, which is dealt with in article 22, also amounts to deprivation of personal liberty which is referred to in article 21, and is a violation of the right of freedom of movement dealt with in article 19 (1) (d). That there are other instances of overlapping of articles in the Constitution may be illus- trated by reference to article 19 (1) (f) and article 31 both of which deal with the right to property and to some extent overlap each other. It appears that some learned High Court Judges, who had to deal with the very question before us, were greatly impressed by the statement in the report of the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly on article 15 (corresponding to the present article 21), that the word ""liberty"" should be qualified by the insertion of the word ""personal"" before it for otherwise it may be construed very widely so as to include the freedoms dealt with in article 13 (corresponding to the present article 19). I am not however prepared to hold that this statement is decisive on the question of the construction of the words used in article 19 (1) (d) which are quite plain and can be construed without any extraneous help. Whether the report of the Drafting Commit- tee and the debates on the floor of the House should be used at all in construing the words of a statute, which are words of ordinary and common use and are not used in any technical or peculiar sense, is a debatable question; and whether they can be used in aid of a construction which is a strain upon the language used in the clause to be interpreted is a still more doubtful matter. But, apart from these legal consider- ations, it is, I think, open to us to analyse the statement and see whether it goes beyond adding a somewhat plausible reason--a superficially plausible reason--for a slight verbal change in article 21. It seems clear that the addi- tion of the word ""personal"" before ""liberty"" in article 21 cannot change the meaning of the words used in article 19, nor can it put a matter which is inseparably bound up with personal liberty beyond its place. Personal liberty and personal freedom, in spite of the use of the word ""personal ,"" are, as we find in several books, sometimes used in a wide sense and embrace freedom of speech, freedom of .asso- ciation, etc. These rights are some of the most valuable phases or elements of liberty and they do not cease to be so by the addition of the word ""personal."" A general statement by the Drafting Committee referring to freedom in plural cannot take the place of an authoritative exposition of the meaning of the words used in article 19 (1)(d), which has not been specifically referred to and cannot be such an overriding consideration as to compel us to put a meaning opposed to reason and authority. The words used in article 19 (1) (d) must be construed as they stand, and we have to decide upon the words themselves whether in the .case of preventive detention the right under article 19 (1) (d) is or is not infringed. But, as I shall point out later, however literally we may construe the words used in article 19 (1) (d) and however restricted may be the meaning we may attribute to those words, there can be no escape from the conclusion that preventive detention is a direct infringe- ment of the right guaranteed in article 19 (1) (d). Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 42 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 Having dealt with the principal objections, I wish to revert once again to the main topic. The expressions ""per- sonal liberty"" and"" personal freedom"" have, as we find in several books, a wider meaning and also a narrower meaning. In the wider sense, they include not only immunity from arrest and detention but also freedom of speech, freedom of association, etc. In the narrower sense, they mean immunity from arrest and detention. I have shown that the juristic conception of ""personal liberty ,"" when these words are used in the sense of immunity from arrest, is. that it consists in freedom of movement and locomotion. I have also pointed out that this conception is at the root of the criminal law of England and of this country, so far as the offences of false imprisonment and wrongful confinement are concerned. The gravamen of these offences is restraint on freedom of movement. With these facts in view, I have tried to find out whether there is any freedom of movement known in England apart from personal liberty used in the sense of immunity from arrest and detention, but I find no trace of any such freedom. In Halsbury's Laws of England (2nd Edition, volume 6, page 391), the freedoms mentioned are the right to per- sonal freedom (or immunity from detention or confinement), the right to property, the right to freedom of speech, the right of public meeting, the right of association, etc. Similar classifications will be found in Dicey's ""Introduc- tion to the Study of the Law of the Constitution"" and Keith's ""Constitutional Law"" and other books on constitu- tional subjects, but there is no reference anywhere to any freedom or right of movement in the sense in which we are asked to. construe the words used in article 19 (1) (d).. In the Constitutions of America, Ireland and many other countries where freedom is prized, there is no reference to freedom or right of movement as something distinct from personal liberty used in the sense of immunity from arrest and confinement. The obvious explanation is that in legal conception no freedom or right of movement exists apart from what personal liberty connotes and therefore a separate treatment of this freedom was not necessary. It is only in the Constitution of the Free City of Danzig, which covers an area of 701 square miles, that we find these words in article 75 :-- ""All nationals shall enjoy freedom of movement within the City."" There is however no authoritative opinion available to support the view that this freedom is anything different from what is otherwise called personal liberty. The problem of construc- tion in regard to this particular right in the Constitution of Danzig is the same as in our Constitution. Such being the general position, I am confirmed in my view that the juristic conception that personal liberty and freedom of movement connote the same thing is the correct and true conception, and the words used in article 10 (1) (d) must be construed according to this universally accepted legal conception. This conclusion is further supported by reference to the war legislation in England and in India, upon which the law of preventive detention, which has been in force in this country since the war, is based. In the first world war, the British Parliament passed the Defence of the Realm Consoli- dation Act, in 1914, and a number of regulations were made under it including regulation 14-B, which permitted the Secretary of State to subject any person ""to such obliga- tions and restrictions as hereinafter mentioned in view of his hostile origin or associations."" Lord Atkin in refer- ring to this regulation said in Liversidge v. Sir John Anderson (1), ""that the regulation undisputedly gave to a Secretary of State unrestricted power to detain a suspected person."" Apparently, Lord Atkin meant that the restriction referred to in the Act included preventive detention. Under this regulation, one Arthur Zadig was interned, and he applied to the King's Bench for a writ of habeas corpus which was refused. The matter ultimately came up before the House of Lords in Rex v. Halliday (2), and the noble Lords in dealing with the case proceeded on the assumption that there was no difference Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 43 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 between internment and incarceration or imprisonment. Lord Shaw in narrating the facts of the case stated :-- (1) [1942] A.C. 238. (2) [1917] A.C. 260. His person was seized, he has been interned ...... The appellant lost his liberty and was interned ......"" He then proceeded to state that there was no difference between internment and imprisonment and quoted the following passage from Blackstone :-- ""The confinement of the person, in any wise, is an imprisonment. So that the keeping a man against his will in a private house, putting him in the stocks, arresting or forcibly detaining him in the street, is an imprisonment."" Proceeding on this footing (which I find to be the common basis in all other speeches delivered in the case, though Lord Shaw had given a dissenting judgment), Lord Finlay while dealing with the provisions of the regulations observed :-- ""One of the most obvious means of taking precautions against dangers such as are enumerated is to impose some restriction on the freedom of movement of persons whom there may be any reason to suspect of being disposed to help the enemy ""(1). Again, Lord Atkinson while dealing with the merits of the case made the following observations :-- ""If the legislature chooses to enact that he can be deprived of his liberty and incarcerated or interned for certain things for which he could not have been heretofore incarcerated or interned, that enactment and the orders made under it if intra vires do not infringe upon the Habeas Corpus Acts or take away any right conferred by Magna Charta ...... ,, (2). This passage read with the previous passage quoted by me will show that both internment and incarceration were re- garded as ""restrictions on the freedom of movement ""and that deprivation of liberty and restriction on freedom of move- ment were used as alternative expressions bearing the same meaning. The same conclusion is to be drawn by reference to the regulations made in the last world war under the Emergency Powers (Defence)Act, 1939. The regulation which directly dealt-with detention orders was 18-B. This regulation and a number of other regulations have been placed in Part I under the heading"" Restrictions (1) [1917] A.C. 269. (2) [1917] A.C. 272. On movements and activities of persons ."" The classifica- tion is important, because it meets two principal arguments advanced in this case. It shows firstly that detention is a form of restriction and secondly that it is a restriction on movement. I have noticed that"" movement"" is used in plural, and Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 44 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 the heading also refers to restrictions on activities, but, having regard to the subjects classified under this head, movement undoubtedly refers to physical movement and includes such movements as entering a particu- lar locality, going from one place to another, etc., i.e., the very things to which article 19 (1) (d) is said to have reference. In Liversidge's case, in construing the provi- sions of the Act of 1939, Viscount Maugham observed as follows :-- ""The language of the Act of 1939 (above cited) shows beyond doubt that Defence Regulations may be made which must deprive the subject ""whose detention appears to the Secre- tary of State to be expedient in the interests of public safety"" of all his liberty of movement while the regulations remain in force""(1). Thus Viscount Maugham also considered detention to be synonymous with deprivation of liberty of movement. The classification that we find in the Defence of the Realm Regulations was with a little verbal modification adopted in the Defence of India Rules, and we find that here also rule 26, which dealt with preventive detention, has been placed under the heading ""Restriction of movements and activities of persons."" A somewhat similar classification has also been adopted in a series of Provincial Acts and Ordinances relating to maintenance of order [see section 2 of the Bihar Maintenance of Public Order. Act, 1949, section 16 of the West Bengal Security Act, 1948, section 4 of the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, section 2 of the Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act, 1947, section 3 of the U.P. Maintenance of Public Order Temporary Act, 1947, and section 2 of the Bombay Public Security Measures Act, 1947. In these Acts and Ordinances, preventive detention and certain (1) [1942] A.C. 219. other forms of restriction on movement such as internment, externment, etc. have been classed together and dealt with more or less on the same footing, and sometimes they have been dealt with in different clauses of the same section. In one of the Acts, the same advisory board is to deal with the case of a detenue as well as that of an externed person, and there are also similar provisions giving them the right to represent their case to the Government. I will now assume for the sake of argument that the freedom of movement to which reference is made in article 19 (1) (d) has nothing to do with personal liberty and that the words which occur in the article bear the restricted meaning attributed to them by the learned Attorney-General and some of my colleagues. It seems to me that even on this assump- tion, it is difficult to arrive at any conclusion other than what I have already arrived at. There can be no doubt that preventive detention does take away even this limited free- dom of movement directly and substantially, and, if so, I do not see how it can be argued that the right under article 19 (1) (d) is not infringed if the alternative interpretation is accepted. We have only to ask ourselves: Does a person who is detained retain even a fraction of his freedom of movement in howsoever restricted sense the term may be used and does he not lose his right to move freely from one place to another or visit any locality he likes as a necessary result of his detention ? I think I should refer here once more to the fact that in the Defence of the Realm Regula- tions and Defence of India Rules, preventive detention is classed under the heading ""Restriction of movements and activities."" ""Movement"" is here used in plural and Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 45 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 refers to that very type of movement which is said to be protected by article 19 (1) (d), moving from one State or place to another, visiting different localities, etc. One of the objects of 'preventive detention is to restrain the person detained from moving from place to. place so that he may not spread disaffection or indulge in dangerous activities in the' places he visits. The same consideration applies to the cases of persons who are interned or externed. Hence, externment, internment and certain other forms of restriction on move- ment have always been treated as kindred matters belonging to the same group or family and the rule which applies to one must necessarily apply to the other. It is difficult to hold that the case of externment can possibly be dealt with on a different footing from the case of preventive deten- tion. I am however interested to find that the Patna and Bombay High Courts have held that a person who is externed can successfully assert that the right granted to him under article 19 (1) (d) has been violated. This view has not been seriously challenged before us, and, if it is correct, I really do not see how it can be held that preventive deten- tion is also not a direct invasion of the right guaranteed in article 19 (1) (d). Perhaps, one may pause here to ask what kind of laws were in contemplation of the framers of the Constitution when they referred to laws imposing re- strictions in the public interest in article 19 (5). I think the war laws and the Provincial Acts and Ordinances to which I have already referred must have been among them, these being laws which expressly purport to impose restrictions on movements. If so, we should not overlook the fact that preventive detention was an inseparable part of these laws and was treated as a form of restriction on movement and classified as such. It seems to me that when the matter is seriously considered, it would be found that the interpreta- tion of the learned Attorney-General attracts the operation of article 13 (2) no less strongly and directly than the interpretation I have suggested, and I prefer the latter only because I consider that it is legally unsound to treat what is inseparably bound up with and is the essential element in the legal concept 1of personal liberty as a wholly separate and unconnected entity. But, as I have already indicated, it will be enough for the purpose of this case if we forget all about personal liberty and remember only that detention is, as is self-evident and as has been pointed out by Viscount Maugham and other eminent judges, another name for depriving a person of all his ""liberty of movement."" It was pointed out in the course of the arguments that preventive detention not only takes away the right in article 19 (1) (d) but also takes away all the other rights guaranteed by article 19 (1), except the right to hold, acquire and dispose of property. Where exactly this argu- ment is intended to lead us to, I cannot fully understand, but it seems to me that it involves an obvious fallacy, because it overlooks the difference in the modes in which preventive detention operates on the right referred to in sub-clause (d) and other sub-clauses of article 19 (1). The difference is that while preventive detention operates on freedom of movement directly and inevitably, its operation on the other rights is indirect and consequential and is, often only notional. One who is preventively detained is straightaway deprived of his right of movement as a direct result of his detention, but he loses the other rights only in consequence of his losing freedom of movement. Beside% while freedom of movement is lost by him in all reality and substance, some of the other rights may not be lost until he wishes to exercise them or is interested in exercising them. A person who is detained may not be interested in freedom of association or may not pursue any profession, occupation, trade or business. In such a case, the rights referred to are lost only in theory and not as a matter of substance. I wish only to add that when I said that I was not able to understand the full force of the argument which I have tried to deal with, what I had, in mind was that if preventive detention Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 46 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 sweeps away or affects almost all the rights guaranteed in article. 19 (1), the matter deserves very serious consideration and we cannot lightly lay down that article 13 (2) does not come into operation. Being fully alive to the fact that it is a serious matter to be asked to declare a law enacted by Parliament to be unconstitutional, I have again and again asked myself the question: What are we to put in the scales against the construction which I am inclined to adopt and in favour of the view that preventive detention does not take away the freedom of movement guaranteed in article 19 (1) (d)? The inevitable answer has always been that while in one of the scales we have plain and unambiguous language, the opinion eminent jurists, judicial dicta of high authority, constitu- tional practice in the sense that no Constitution refers to any freedom of movement apart from personal liberty, and the manner in which preventive detention has been treated in the very laws on which our law on this subject is based, all that we can put in the opposite scale is a vague and ill- rounded apprehension that some fearful object such as the revision of the Penal .Code is looming obscurely in the distant horizon, the peculiar objection that the mere men- tion of the scheduled tribes will alter the meaning of certain plain words, the highly technical and unreal dis- tinction between restriction and deprivation and the assump- tion not warranted by any express provision that a person who is preventively detained cannot claim the right of freedom of movement because he is not a free man and certain other things which, whether taken singly or ,collectively, are too unsubstantial to carry any weight. In these circum- stances, I am strongly of the view that article 19 (1)(d) guarantees the right of freedom of movement in its widest sense, that freedom of movement being the essence of person- al liberty, the right guaranteed under the article is really a right to personal liberty and that preventive detention is a deprivation of that right. I am also of the view that even on the interpretation suggested by the learned Attor- ney-General, preventive detention cannot but be held to be a violation of the right conferred by article 19 ,(1) (d). In either view, therefore, the law of preventive detention is subject to such limited judicial review as is permitted under article 19 (5). The scope of the review is simply to see whether any particular law imposes any unreasonable restrictions. Considering that the restrictions are imposed on a most valuable right, there is nothing revolutionary in 'the legislature trusting the Supreme Court to examine whether an Act which infringes upon that right is within the limits of reason. I will now pass on to the consideration of article 21, which runs as follows :- ""No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law."" Here again, our first step must be to arrive at a clear meaning of the provision. The only words which cause some difficulty in the proper construction of the article are ""procedure established by law."" The learned Attorney-General contended before us that the word ""law"" which is used in article 21 means State-made law or law enacted by the State. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the petitioner strongly contended that the expression ""procedure established by law"" is used in a much wider sense and approximates in meaning to the expres- sion ""due process of law"" as interpreted by Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 47 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 the Supreme COurt of America in the earliest times and, if that is so, it means exactly what some of the American writers mean to convey by the expression ""procedural due process."" In the course of the arguments, the learned Attorney- General referred us to the proceedings in the Constituent Assembly for the purpose of showing that the article as originally drafted contained the words ""without due process of law"" but these words were subsequently replaced by the words ""except according to procedure established by law."" In my opinion, though the proceedings or discussions in the Assembly are not relevant for the purpose of construing the meaning of the expressions used in article 21, especially when they are plain and unambiguous, they are relevant to show that the Assembly intended to avoid the use of the expression ""without due process of law."" That expression had its roots in the expression ""per legem terrae"" (law of the land) used in Magna Charta in 1215. In the reign of Edward III, 'however, the words ""due process of law"" were used in a statute guaranteeing that no person will be de- prived of his property or imprisoned or indicted or put to death without being brought in to answer by due process of law (28, Edward III, Ch. III). The expression was after- wards adopted in the American Constitution and also in the Constitutions of some of the constituent States, though some of the States preferred to use the words ""in due course of law"" or ""according to the law of the land."" [See Cooley on ""Constitutional Limitations,"" 8th Edn. Vol. II, pages 734-51. In the earliest times, the American Supreme Court construed ""due process of law"" to cover matters of procedure only, but gradually the meaning of the expression was widened so as to cover substantive law also, by laying emphasis on the word ""due."" The expression was used in such a wide sense that the judges found it difficult to define it and in one of the cases it was ob- served as follows :-- ""It would be difficult and perhaps impossible to give to those words a definition, at once accurate, and broad enough to cover every case. This difficulty and perhaps impossi- bility was referred to by Mr. Justice Miller in Davidson v. New Orleans, where the opinion was expressed that it is wiser to ascertain their intent and application by the 'gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion,' as the cases presented for decision shall require, with the reasoning on which such decisions may be rounded:"" Missouri Pacific Railway Co. v. Humes (1). It seems plain that the Constituent Assembly did not adopt this expression on account of the very elastic meaning given to it, but preferred to use the words ""according to procedure established by law"" which occur in the Japanese Constitution framed in 1946. It will not be out of place to state here in a few words how the Japanese Constitution came into existence. It appears that on the 11th October, 1945. General McArthur directed the Japanese Cabinet to initiate measures for the preparation of the Japanese Constitution, but, as no progress was made, it was. decided in February, 1946, that the problem of constitutional reform should be taken over by the Government Section of the Supreme Commander's Headquar- ters. Subsequently the Chief of this Section ,and the staff drafted the Constitution with the help of American constitu- tional lawyers who were called to assist the Government Section in the task. This Constitution, as a learned writer has remarked, bore (1) 115 U.S. 512 at page 513. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 48 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 on almost every page evidences of its essentially Western origin, and this characteristic was especially evident in the preamble ""particularly reminiscent of the American Declaration of Independence, a preamble which, it has been observed, no Japanese could possibly have conceived or written and which few could even understand"" [See Ogg and Zink's ""Modern Foreign Governments""]. One of the character- istics of the Constitution which undoubtedly bespeaks of direct American influence is to be found in a lengthy chap- ter, consisting of 31 articles, entitled ""Rights and Duties of the People,"" which provided for the first time an effec- tive ""Bill of Rights"" for the Japanese people. The usual safeguards have been provided there against apprehension without a warrant and against arrest or detention without being informed of the charges or without adequate cause (articles 33 and 34). Now there are two matters which deserve to be noticed :--(1) that the Japanese Constitution was framed wholly under American influence; and (2) that at the time it was framed the trend of judicial opinion in America was in favour of confining the meaning of the expression ""due process of law"" to what is expressed by certain American writers by the somewhat quaint but useful expression ""proce- dural due process."" That there was such a trend would be clear from the following passage which I quote from Carl Brent Swisher's ""The Growth of Constitutional Power in the United States"" (page 107.):-- ""The American history of its interpretation falls into three periods. During the first period, covering roughly the first century of government under the Constitution, due process was interpreted principally as a restriction upon procedure--and largely the judicial procedure--by which the government exercised its powers. During the second period, which, again roughly speaking, extended through 1936, due process was expanded to serve as a restriction not merely upon procedure but upon the substance of the activities in which the government might engage. During the third period, extending from 1936 to date, the use of due process as a substantive restriction has been largely sus- pended or abandoned, leaving it principally in its original status as a restriction upon procedure."" In the circumstances mentioned, it seems permissible to surmise that the expression ""procedure established by law"" as used in the Japanese Constitution represented the current trend of American judicial opinion with regard to ""due process of law,"" and, if that is so, the expression as used in our Constitution means all that the American writers have read into the words ""procedural due process."" But I do not wish to base any conclusions upon mere surmise and will try to examine the whole question on its merits. The word ""law"" may be used in an abstract or concrete sense. Sometimes it is preceded by an article such as ""a"" or ""the"" or by such words as ""any,"" ""all,"" Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 49 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 etc., and sometimes it is used without any such prefix. But, generally, the word ""law"" has a wider meaning when used in the abstract sense without being preceded by an article. The question to be decided is whether the word ""law"" means nothing more than statute law. Now whatever may be the meaning of the expression ""due process of law,"" the word ""law"" is common to that expression as well as ""procedure established by law"" and though we are not bound to adopt the construction put on ""law"" or ""due process of law"" in America, yet since a number of eminent American Judges have devoted much thought to the subject, I am not prepared to hold that we can derive no help from their opinions and we should completely ignore them. I will therefore in the first instance set out certain quotations from a few of the .decisions of the American Supreme Court construing the word ""law"" as used in the expression ""due process of law,"" in so far as it bears on the question of legal procedure. (1) ""Although the legislature may at its pleasure provide new remedies or change old ones, the power is never- theless subject to the condition that it cannot remove certain ancient land-marks, or take away certain fundamen- tal rights which have been always recognized and observed in judicial procedures:"" Bardwell v. Collins (1). (2)' 'By the law of the land is most clearly intended the general law: a law which hears before it condemns, which proceeds upon inquiry and renders judgments only- after trial. The meaning is that every citizen shall hold his life, liberty and property, and immunities under the protection of the general rules which govern society:"" Dartmouth College Case (2). (3) ""Can it be doubted that due process of law signifies a right to be heard in one's defence ? If the legislative department of the government were to enact a statute confer- ring the right to condemn the citizen without any opportuni- ty whatever of being heard, would it be pretended that such an enactment would not be violative of the Constitution ? If this be true, as it undoubtedly is, how can it be said that the judicial department. the source and fountain of justice itself, has yet the authority to render lawful that which if done under express legislative sanction would be viola of the Constitution ? If such power obtains, then the judicial department of the government sitting to uphold and enforce the Constitution is the only one possessing a power to disregard it. If such authority exists then in conse- quence of their establishment, to compel obedience to law and enforce justice, Courts possess the right to inflict the very wrongs which they were created to prevent:"" Hovey v. Elliott(3). Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 50 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 (4) ""It is a rule as old as the law, and never more to be respected than now, that no one shall be personally bound until he has had his say in Court, by which is meant, until he has been duly cited to appear, and has been afforded an opportunity to be heard. Judgment without such citation and opportunity wants all the attributes of a judicial determi- nation; it is judicial usurpation and oppression, and can never be upheld where justice is justly administered:"" Gatpin v. Page(4). Thus, in America, the word ""law"" does not mean merely State-made law or law enacted by the State and does not exclude certain fundamental principles of (1) 44 Minn. 97; 9 L.R.A. 152. (3) 167 U.S. 409 at page 417. (2) 17 U.S. 4. (4) 85 U.S. 18. justice which inhere in every civilized system of law and which are at the root of it. The result of the numerous decisions in America has been summed up by Professor Willis in his book on ""Constitutional Law"" at page 662, in the statement that the essentials of due process are: (1) no- tice, (2) opportunity to be heard, (3) an impartial tribu- nal, and (4) orderly course of procedure. It is pointed out by the learned author that these essentials may assume different forms in different circumstances, and so long as they are conceded in principle, the requirement of law will be fulfilled. For example, a person cannot require any particular form or method of hearing, but all that he can require is a reasonable opportunity to be heard. Similarly, an impartial tribunal does not necessarily mean a judicial tribunal in every case. So far as 'orderly course of proce- dure is concerned, he explains that it does not require a 'Court to strictly weigh the ,evidence but it does require it to examine the entire record to ascertain the issues, to discover whether there are facts not reported and to see whether or not the law has been correctly applied to facts. The view expressed by other writers is practically the same as that expressed by Professor Willis, though some of them do not expressly refer to the fourth element, viz., orderly course of procedure. The real point however is that these four elements are really different aspects of the same right, viz., the right to be heard before one is condemned. So far as this right is concerned, -judicial opinion in England appears to be the same as that in America. In Eng- land, it would shock one to be told that a man can be de- prived of his personal liberty without a fair trial or hearing. Such a case can happen if the Parliament expressly takes away the right in question in an emergency as the British Parliament did during// the last two world wars in a limited number of cases. I will refer here to a few cases which show that the fundamental principle that a person whose right is affected must be heard has been observed not only in cases involving personal liberty but also 'in proceedings affecting other rights, even though they may have come before administrative or quasi-judicial tribunals. Cooper v. The Wadsworth Board of Works (1)was a case under an Act which empowered the District Board to alter or demol- ish a house where the builder had neglected to give notice of his intention. seven days before proceeding to lay or dig the foundation. Acting upon this power, the Board directed the demolition of a building without notice to the builder, but this was held to be illegal. Byles 5. in dealing with the matter observed as follows :-- Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 51 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 ""I conceive they acted judicially, because they had to determine the offence, and they had to apportion the punish- ment as well as the remedy. That being so, a long course of decisions, beginning with Dr. Bentley's case, and ending with some very recent cases, establish that although there are no positive words in a statute requiring that the party-shall be heard, yet the justice of the common law will supply the omission of the legislature. The judgment of Mr. Justice Fortescue, in Dr. Bentley's case, is somewhat quaint, but it is very applicable, and has been the law from that time to the present. He says, ""The. objection for want of notice can never be got over. The laws of God and man both give the party an opportunity to make his defence, if he has any."" In the same case Erie C.J. observed :-- ""It has been said that the principle that no man shall be deprived of his property without an opportunity of being heard, is limited to a judicial proceeding...... I do not quite agree with that; ......the law, I think, has been applied to many exercises of power which in common under- standing would not be at all more a judicial proceeding than would be the act of the District Board in ordering a house to be pulled down."" The observations made by Erie C.J. were quoted and applied by Sir Robert Collier in Smith v. The' Queen (2), and the observations of Lord Campbell in Regina v. The Archbishop of Canterbury (3) were to the. same effect. (1) 14 C.B. (N.S.) 180. (2) 3 A.C. 614. (3) 1E.& E. 559. A similar opinion was expressed by Sir GeorgeJessel in Fisher v. Keane (1), Labouchere v. Earl of Wharncliffe (2), and Russell v. Russell (3). In the last mentioned case, he observed as follows :-- ""It [Wood v. Woad (4)] contains a very valuable state- ment by the Lord Chief Baron as to his view of the mode of administering justice by persons other than Judges who have judicial functions to perform which I should have been very glad to have had before me on both those club cases that I recently heard, namely, the case of Fisher v. Keane and the case of Labouchere v. Earl of Wharncliffe. The passage I mean is this, referring to a committee: 'They are bound in the exercise of their functions by the rule expressed in the maxim ""audi alteram partem,"" that no man should be condemned to consequences without having the opportunity of making his defence. This rule is not confined to the con- duct of strictly legal' tribunals, but is applicable to every tribunal or body of persons invested with authority to adjudicate upon matters involving civil consequences to individuals '."" This opinion was quoted with approval by Lord Macnaghten in Lapointe v. L'Association etc. de Montreal (5). In that case, on an application for pension by the appellant, who had been obliged to resign, the Board of Directors, without any judicial inquiry into the circumstances, resolved to refuse the claim on the ground that he was obliged to tender his resignation. This procedure was Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 52 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 condemned by Lord Macnaghten as being ""contrary to rules of society and above all contrary to the elementary principles of justice."" These observations of Lord Macnaghten were referred to and relied on in The King v. Tribunal of Appeal under the Hous- ing Act, 1919 (6). In that case, a company proposed to build a picture house and the local authority having prohibited 'the building, the company appealed under the Housing (1) H. Ch. D. 353. (4) [1874] L.R. 9 Ex. 190.

(Additional Powers) Act, 1919, which contained a provision that an appeal could in certain cases be properly determined without a hearing and that the appellate Court could dis- pense with the hearing and determine the appeal summarily. It was held that the meaning of rule 7 was that the tribunal on appeal might dispense with an oral hearing, not that they might dispense with a hearing of any kind, and that they were bound to give the appellants a hearing in the sense of an opportunity to make out a case. The Earl of Reading in delivering the judgment observed: ""The principle of law applicable to such a case is well stated by Kelly C.B. in Wood v. Woad in a passage which is cited with approval by Lord Macnaghten in Lapointe v. L' Association etc. de Montreal ...... "" In Local Government Board v. Arlidge(1), the Local Government dismissed an appeal by a person against whom a closing order had been made under Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act, without an oral hearing and without being allowed to see the report made by the Board's Inspector upon 'public local inquiry. The House of Lords did not interfere with the order on the ground that the appeal had been dealt with by an administrative authority whose duty was to enforce obligations on the individual in the interests of the commu- nity and whose character was that of an organization with executive functions. The principle however was conceded and lucidly set forth that when the duty of deciding an appeal is imposed, those whose duty it is to decide it must act judicially, and they must deal with the question referred to them without bias and must give to each of the parties an opportunity of presenting its case, and that the decision must be come to in the spirit and with the sense of respon- sibility of a tribunal whose duty it is to mete out justice. Commenting upon this case, which is generally regarded as an extreme case, Mr. Gavin Simonds, who afterwards became a member of the House of Lords observes :-- (1) [1915] A.C.120. ""I think you would agree that if the subjectmatter of such proceedings as arc here indicated was the liberty of the subject, or indeed his life, you would regard such a judicial procedure as outrageous."" (See C.K. Allen's ""Law and Orders,"" page 167). I have particularly referred to cases which were before administrative tribunals, because I have to deal in this case with preventive detention which is said to be an execu- tive act and because I wish to point out that even before executive authorities Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 53 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 and administrative tribunals an order cannot generally be passed affecting one's rights without giving one such hearing as may be appropriate to the circum- stances of the case. I have only to add that Halsbury after enumerating the most important liberties which are recog- nized in England, such as right of personal freedom, right to freedom of speech, right of public meeting, etc., adds :-- ""It seems to me that there should be added to this list the following rights which appear to have become well-estab- lished--the right of the subject to have any case affecting him tried in accordance with the principles of natural justice, particularly the principles that a man may not be a judge in his own cause, and that no party ought to be con- demned unheard, or to have a decision given against him unless he has been given a reasonable opportunity of putting forward his case ...... ""(Halsbury's Laws of England, 2nd Edition, volume 6, page 392). The question is whether the principle that no person can be condemned without a hearing by an impartial tribunal which is well-recognized in all modern civilized systems of law and which Halsbury puts on a par with well-recognized fundamental rights cannot be regarded as part of the law of this country. I must confess that I find it difficult to give a negative answer to this question. The principle being part of the British system of law and procedure which we have inherited, has been observed in this country for a very long the and is also deeply rooted in our ancient history, being the basis of the panchayat system from the earliest times. The whole of the Criminal Procedure Code, whether it deals with trial of offences or with preventive or quasiadministrative measures such as are contemplated in sections 107, 108, 109, 110 and 145, is based upon the foundation of this principle, and it is difficult to see that it has not become part of the ""law of the land"" and does not inhere in our system of law. If that is so, then ""procedure established by law"" must include this principle, whatever else it may or may not include. That the word ""law"" used in article 21 does not mean only State-made law is clear from the fact that though there is no statute laying down the complete procedure to be adopted in contempt of Court cases, when the contempt is not within the view of the Court, yet such procedure as now prevails in these cases is part of our law. The statute-law which regulates the procedure of trials and enquiries in criminal cases does not specifically provide for arguments in certain cases, but it has always been held that no decision should be pronounced without hearing arguments. In a number of cases, it has been held that though there may be no specific provision for notice in the statute, the provision must be read into the law. I am aware that some Judges have ex- pressed a strong dislike for the expression ""natural jus- tice"" on the ground that it is too vague and elastic, but where there are well-known principles with no vagueness about them, which all systems of law have respected and recognized, they cannot be discarded merely because they are in the ultimate analysis found to be based on natural jus- tice. That the expression ""natural justice"" is not unknown to our law is apparent from the fact that the Privy Council has in many criminal appeals from this country laid down that it shall exercise its power of interference with the course of criminal justice in this country Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 54 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 when there has been a breach of principles of natural justice or departure from the requirements of justice. [See In re Abraham Mallory Dillet (1), Taba Singh v. King Emperor C), George Gfeller v. The (1) 12 A.C. 459. (2) I.L.R. 48 Born. 515. King(1), and Bugga and others v. Emperor(2). In the present case, there is no vagueness about the right claimed which is the right to have one's guilt or innocence considered by an impartial body and that right must be read into the words of article 21. Article 21 purports to protect life and person- al liberty, and it would be a precarious protection and a protection not worth having, if the elementary principle of law under discussion which, according to Halsbury is on a par with fundamental rights, is to be ignored and excluded. In the course of his arguments, the learned counsel for the petitioner repeatedly asked whether the Constitution would permit a law being enacted, abolishing the mode of trial permitted by the existing law and establishing the procedure of trial by battle or trial by ordeal which was in vogue in olden times in England. The question envisages something which is not likely to happen, but it does raise a legal problem which can perhaps be met only in tiffs way that if the expression ""procedure established by law"" simply means any procedure established or enacted by statute it will be difficult to give a negative answer to the question, but ii the word ""law"" includes what I have endeavoured to show it does, such an answer may be justified. It seems to me that there is nothing revolutionary in the doctrine that the words ""procedure established by law"" must include the four principles set out in Professor Willis' book, which, as I have already stated, are different aspects of the same principle and which have no vagueness or uncertainty about them. These principles, as the learned author points out and as the authorities show, are not absolutely rigid principles but are adaptable to the circumstances of each case within certain limits. I have only to add that it has not been seriously controverted that ""law"" in this article means valid law and ""procedure"" means certain definite rules of proceeding and not something which is a mere pretence for procedure. I will now proceed to examine article 22 of the Consti- tution which specifically deals with the subject (1) A.I.R. 1943P.C. 211. (2) A.I.R. 1919P. C. 108. of preventive detention. The first point to be noted in regard to this article is that it does not exclude the operation of articles 19 and 21, and it must be read subject to those two articles, in the same way as articles 19 and 21 must be read subject to article 22. The correct position is that article 22 must prevail in so far as there are specific provisions therein regarding preventive detention, but, where there are no such provisions in that article, the operation of articles 19 and 21 cannot be excluded. The mere fact that different aspects of the same right have been dealt with in three different articles will not make them mutually exclusive except to the extent I have indicated. I will now proceed to analyse the article and deal with its main provisions. In my opinion, the main provisions of this article are :--(1) that no person can be detained beyond three months without the report of an advisory board [clause 4 (a) ]; (2) that the Parliament may prescribe the circumstances and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for more than three months without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board [clause 7 (a)]; (3) that when a person is preventively detained, the author- ity making the order of detention shall communicate to such person the grounds on which the order is made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representa- tion against the order [clause (5) ]; and (4) that the Parliament may prescribe the maximum period for which Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 55 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 any person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law providing for preventive detention [clause 7 (b) ]. The last point does not require any consideration in this case, but the first three points do require considera- tion. In connection with the first point, the question arises as to the exact meaning of the words ""such detention"" occur- ring in the end of clause 4 (a). Two alternative interpre- tations were put forward: (1) ""such detention"" means preven- tive detention; (2) ""such detention"" means detention for a period longer than three months. If the first interpreta- tion is correct, then the function of the advisory board would be to go into the merits of the case of each person and simply report whether there was sufficient cause for his detention. According to the other interpretation, the function of the advisory board will be to report to the government whether there is sufficient cause for the person being detained for more than three months. On the whole, I am inclined to agree with the second interpretation. Prima facie, it is a seri- ous matter to detain a person for a long period (more than three months) without any enquiry or trial. But article 22 (4) (a) provides that such detention may be ordered on the report of the advisory board. Since the report must be directly connected with the object for which it is required, the safeguard provided by the article, viz., calling for a report from the advisory board, loses its value, if the advisory board is not to apply its mind to the vital ques- tion before the government, namely, whether prolonged deten- tion (detention for more than three' months) is justified or not. Under article 22 (4) (a), the advisory board has to submit its report before the expiry of three months and may therefore do so on the eighty-ninth day. It would be some- what farcical to provide, that after a man has been detained for eighty-nine days, an advisory board is to say whether ' his initial detention was justified. On the other hand, the determination of the question whether prolonged detention (detention for more than three months)is justified must necessarily involve the determination of the question wheth- er the detention was justified at all, and such an interpre- tation only can give real meaning and effectiveness to the provision. The provision being in the nature of a protection or safeguard, I must naturally lean towards the interpreta- tion which is favourable to the subject and which is also in accord with the object in view. The next question which we have to discuss relates to the meaning and scope of article 22 (7)(a) which runs as follows:- ""Parliament may by law prescribe--- (a) the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preven- tive detention without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause (a) of clause (4)."" The question is what is meant by ""circumstances""' and ""class or classes of cases"" used in this provision. This question has arisen because of the way in which these ex- pressions appear to have been interpreted and applied in the Act of Parliament with which we are concerned. As the matter is important and somewhat complicated, I shall try to express my Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 56 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 meaning as clearly as possible even at the risk of some repetition, and, in doing so, I must necessarily refer to the impugned Act as well as Lists I and III of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, under which Parliament had jurisdiction to enact it. Item 9 of List I--Union List--shows that the Parliament has power to legislate on preventive detention for reasons connected with (1) defence, (2) foreign affairs, and (3) security of India.. Under List III--Concurrent List--the appropriate item is item 3 which shows that law as to preventive detention can be made for reasons connected with (1) the security of the State, (2) the maintenance of public order, and (3) the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community. The impugned Act refers to all the subjects mentioned in Lists I and III in regard to which law of preventive detention can be made. Section 3 (1)of the Act, the substance of which has already been mentioned, is important, and I shall reproduce it verbatim. ""The Central Government or the State Government may- (a) if satisfied with respect to any person that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to- (i) the defence of India, the relations of India with foreign powers, or the security of India, or (ii) the security of the State or the maintenance of public order, or (iii) the maintenance of supplies and services essen- tial to the community, or (b) if satisfied with respect to any person who is a foreigner within the meaning of the Foreigners Act, 1946 (XXXI of 1946), that with a view to regulating his continued presence in India or with a view to making arrangements for his expulsion from India, it is necessary so to do, make an order directing that such person be detained."" It will be noticed that all the subjects of legislation concerning preventive detention occurring in item of List I are grouped in sub-clause (1) of clause (a). The subjects in this group are three in number and, for convenience of reference, I shall hereafter refer to them as A, B and C. In sub-.clause (ii), we find grouped two of the matters referred to in item 3 of List III, these being security of the State and the maintenance of public order. These two subjects, I shall refer to as D and E. In sub-clause (iii), reference has been made to the third matter in item 3 of List III, and I shall refer to this subject as F. With this classification, let us now turn to the Constitution itself. On reading articles 22 (4) and 22 (7) together, it would be clear that so long as article 22 (4) (a) holds the field and Parliament does not act under clause (7) (a) of article 22, there must be an advisory board in every case, i.e., if the legislation relates to groups A to F, as it does here, there must be an advisory board for all these groups. Article 22 (7) however practically engrafts an excep- tion. It states in substance that the Parliament may by an Act provide for preventive detention for more than three months without reference to an advisory board, but in such cases it shall be incumbent Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 57 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 on the Parliament to prescribe (1) the circumstances and (2) the class or classes of cases in which such course is found to be necessary. If the case contemplated in clause (4)(a)is the rule and that contem- plated 'in clause (7) (a) is the exception, then the circum- stances and the class or classes of cases must be of a special or extraordinary nature, so as to take the case out of the rule and bring it within the exception. It is always possible to draw the line between the normal or ordinary and the abnormal or extraordinary cases. and this is what, in my opinion, the Parliament was expected to do under clause (7) (a). I do not think that it was ever intended that Parliament could at its will treat the normal as the abnor- mal or 'the rule as the exception. But this is precisely what has been done in this case- All the items on which preventive legislation is possible excepting one, i.e., A to E, have been put within the exception, and only one, F, which relates to maintenance of supplies and services essen- tial to the community, has been allowed to remain under the rule. In other words, it is provided that there shall be an advisory board only for the last category, F, but no provi- sion having been made for the other categories, A to E, it may be assumed that the advisory board has been dispensed with in those cases. The learned Attorney-General maintained that it would have been open to the Parliament to dispense with the advisory board even for the category F, and if such a course had been adopted it would not have affected the validity of the Act. This is undoubtedly a logical position in the sense that it was necessary for him to go as far as this to justify his stand; but, in my opinion, the course adopted by the Parliament in enacting section 12 of the impugned Act is not what is contemplated under article 22 (7) (a) or is permitted by it. The circumstances to be prescribed must be special and extraordinary circumstances and the class or classes of cases must be of the same na- ture. In my opinion, the Constitution never contemplated that the Parliament should mechanically reproduce all or most of the categories A to F almost verbatim and not apply its mind to decide in what circumstances and in what class or classes of cases the safeguard of an advisory board is to be dispensed with. I may state here that two views are put forward before us as to how clauses (4) (a) and 7 (a) of article 22 are to be read:--(1) that clause (4) (a) lays down the rule that in all cases where detention for more than three months is ordered, it should be done in consultation with and on the report of the advisory board, and clause (7) (a) lays down an exception to this rule by providing that Parliament may pass an Act permitting detention for more than three months without reference to an advisory board; (2) that clauses (4)(a) and (7) (a) are independent clauses making two separate and alternative provisions regarding detention for more than three months, in one case on the report of an advisory board and in other case without reference to an advisory board. Looking at the substance and not merely at the words, I am inclined to hold that clause (7) (a) practically engrafts an exception on the rule that preventive detention for more than three months can be ordered only on the report of an advisory board, and so far I have proceeded on that footing. But it seems to me that it will make no difference to the ulti- mate conclusion, whichever of the two views we may adopt. Even on the latter view, it must be recognized that the law which the Constitution enables the Parliament to make under article 22 (7) (a) would be an exceptionally drastic law, and, on the principle that an exceptionally drastic law must be intended for an exceptional situation, every word of what I have said so far must stand. Clause (7) (a) is only an enabling provision, and it takes care to provide that the Parliament cannot go to the extreme limit to which it is permitted to go without prescribing the class or classes cases and the circumstances to which the extreme law would be applicable. It follows that the class or classes of cases and the circumstances must be of a special Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 58 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 nature to require such legislation. It was urged that the word ""and"" which occurs between ""circumstances"" and ""class or classes of cases"" is used in a disjunctive sense and should be read as ""or,"" and by way of illustration it was mentioned that when it is said that a person may do this and that, it means that he is at liberty to do either this or that. I do not think that this argu- ment is sound. I think that clause (7)(a) can be accurately paraphrased somewhat as follows :--"" Parliament may dispense with an advisory board, but in that case it shall prescribe the circumstances and the class or classes of cases ........ ""If this is the meaning, then ' 'and"" must be read as ""and"" and not as ""or""; and ""may"" must be read as ""shall."" Supposing it was said that Parliament may prescribe the time and place for the doing of a thing, then can it be suggested that both time and place should not be prescribed ? It seems obvious to me that the class or classes of cases must have some reference to the persons to be detained or to their activities and movements or to both. ""Circumstances"" on the other hand refer to something extra- neous, such as surroundings, background, prevailing condi- tions, etc., which might prove a fertile field for the dangerous activities of dangerous persons. Therefore the provision clearly means that both the circumstances and the class or classes of cases (which are two different expres- sions with different meanings and connotations and cannot be regarded as synonymous) should be prescribed, and prescrip- tion of one without prescribing the other will not be enough. As I have already stated, such law as can be enact- ed under article 22 (7) (a) must involve, by reason of the extreme limit to which it can go, serious consequences to the persons detained. It will mean (1) prolonged detention, i.e., detention for a period longer than three months, and (2) deprivation of the safeguard of an advisory board. Hence article 22 (7) (a) which purports to be a protective provi- sion will cease to serve its object unless it is given a reasonable interpretation. To my mind, what it contemplates is that the law in question must not be too general but its scope should be limited by prescribing both the class or classes of cases and the circumstances. It was contended that the expression ""class or classes of cases"" is wide enough to enable the Parliament to treat any of the categories mentioned in Lists I and III, items 9 and 3 respectively, (i.e., any of the categories A to F) as constituting a class. At first sight, it seemed to me to be a plausible argument,, but the more I think about it the more unsound it appears to me. The chief thing to be remem- bered is what I have already emphasized more than once, viz., that a special or extreme type of law must be limited to special classes of cases and circumstances. Under the Constitution, the Parliament has to prescribe ""the class or classes,"" acting within the limits of the power granted to it under Lists I and III. The class or classes must be its own prescription and must be so conceived as to justify by their contents the removal of an important safeguard provid- ed by the Constitution. Prescribing is more than a mere mechanical process. It involves a mental effort to select and adapt the thing prescribed to the object for which it has to be prescribed. We find here that what is to be prescribed is ""class or classes"" (and also ""circumstances ""). We also find that what the law intends to provide is prolonged detention (by which words I shall hereafter mean detention Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 59 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 for more than three months) and elimination of the advisory board. The class or classes to be prescribed must therefore have a direct bearing on these matters and must be so selected and stated that any one by looking at them may say :--"" That is the reason why the law has prescribed prolonged detention without reference to an advisory board."" In other words, there must be something to make the class or classes prescribed fit in with an extreme type of legisla- tion--some element of exceptional gravity or menace, which cannot be easily and immediately overcome and therefore necessitates prolonged detention; and there must be some- thing to show that reference to an advisory board would be an undesirable and cumbersome process and wholly unsuitable for the exceptional situation to which the law applies. Perhaps a simple illustration may make the position still clearer. Under the Lists, one of the subjects on which Parliament may make a law of preventive detention is ""matter connected with the maintenance of public order."" The Act simply repeats this phraseology and states in sec- tion 3: ""with a view to preventing him (the person to be detained) from acting in a manner prejudicial to the main- tenance of public order."" This may be all right for section 3, but section 12 must go further. An act prejudicial to. the maintenance of public order may be an ordinary act or it may be an act of special gravity. I think that article 22 (7)(a) contemplates that the graver and more heinous types of acts falling within the category of acts prejudicial to the maintenance of public order (or other heads) should be prescribed so as to define and cir- cumscribe the area of an exceptional piece of legislation. That some kind of sub-classification (if I may be per- mitted to use this word) of the categories A to F was possi- ble can be illustrated by reference to regulation 18-]3 of the British Defence of the Realm Regulations. This regula- tion was made under an Act of 1039 which authorized ""the making of regulations for the detention of persons whose detention appears to the Secretary of State to be expedient in the interests of public safety or the defence of the realm."" The two matters ""public safety"" and ""defence of the realm"" are analogous to some of the heads stated in Lists I and III. It will be instructive to note that under these two heads, regulation 18-B has set forth several subheads or class or classes of cases in which preventive detention could be ordered. These classes are much more specific than what we find in section a of the impugned Act and therefore there is less chance of misuse by the executive of the power to order preventive detention. The classes set out are these :--(1) If the Secretary of State has reasonable cause to believe any person to be of hostile origin or associa- tions, (2) if the Secretary of State has reasonable cause to believe any person to have been recently concerned in acts prejudicial to the public safety or the defence of the realm or in the preparation or instigation of such acts, (3) if the Secretary of State has reasonable cause to believe any person to have been or to be a member of, or to have been or to be active in the furtherance of the objects of, any such organization as is hereinafter mentioned ...... (a) the organization is subject to foreign influence or control, (b) the persons in control of the organization have or have had associations with, persons concerned in the government of, or sympathies with the system of government of, any Power with which His Majesty is at war, and in either case there is danger of the utilization of the organization for pur- poses prejudicial to the public safety, etc., (4) if the Secretary of State has reasonable cause to believe that the recent conduct of any person for the time being in an area or any words recently written or spoken by such a person expressing sympathy with the enemy, indicates or indicate that person is likely to assist the enemy. I have only to point out that the scope within which preventive detention can be legislat- ed upon in this country is much larger than the scope indi- cated in the British Act under which Regulation 18-B was framed, and therefore there is more scope for specification of the circumstances as well as the class or classes of cases under the impugned Act. But all that has been Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 60 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 done is that words which occur in the legislative Lists have been taken and transferred into the Act. What I have stated with regard to class or classes of cases also applies to the circumstances which are also to be prescribed under article 22 (7) (a). These circumstances are intended to supply the background or setting in which the dangerous activities of dangerous persons might prove specially harmful. They must be special circumstances which demand a specially drastic measure and under which reference to an advisory board might defeat the very object of preven- tive action. The evident meaning of article 22 (7) (a) seems to be that the picture will not be complete without mentioning both the classes and the circumstances. There was some discussion at the Bar as to what kind of circumstances might have been specified. It is not for me to answer this question, but I apprehend that an impending rebellion or war, serious disorder in a particular area such as has induced the Punjab Government to declare certain areas as ""disturbed areas,"" tense communal situation, prevalence of sabotage or widespread political dacoities and a variety of other matters might answer the purpose the Constitution had in view. I will now try to sum up the result of a somewhat pro- tracted discussion into which I had to enter merely to clarify the meaning of a very important provision of the Constitution which has, in my opinion, been completely misunderstood by the framers of the impugned Act. It appears to me that article 22 deals with three classes of preventive detention :-- (1) preventive detention for three months; (2) preventive detention for more than three months on the report of the advisory board; and (3) preventive detention for more than three months without reference to the advisory board. If one has to find some kind of a label for these class- es for a clear understanding of the subject, one may label them as ""dangerous,"" ""more dangerous"" and ""most danger- ous."" Now so far as the first two classes are concerned, there is nothing to be prescribed under the Constitution Apparently, the authors of the Constitution were not much concerned about class No. (1), and they thought that in so far as class No. (2) was concerned the provision that a reference to the advisory board was necessary coupled with the provision that detention was not to exceed the maximum period which may be fixed by the Parliament was enough. But they did take care to make a special provision for class No. (3), and it is extermly important for the liberty of the subject as well as for the smooth working of the Constitu- tion that this provision should not be lightly treated but should receive a well considered and reasonable construc- tion. It is elementary that the rigour of a law should correspond to or fit the gravity of the evil or danger it aims at combating, and it is also evident that the law which the Parliament has been permitted to enact under article 22 (7) (a) can, so far as rigour is concerned, go to the I farthest limit. It follows that the law must have been intended for exceptionally grave situations and exigencies. Hence the authors of the Constitution have made it necessary that the Parliament should put certain specifications into the Act which it is empowered to pass under article 22 (7) (a), so that by means of these specifications the necessity for enacting so drastic a law should be apparent on the face of it, and its application should be confined to the classes and circumstances specified. The Act must prescribe (1) ""c]ass or classes of cases"" which are to have reference to the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 61 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 persons. against whom the law is to operate and their activities and movements and (2) ""circumstances"" which would bring into prominence the conditions and the backgrounds against which dangerous activities should call for special measures. By means of such two-fold prescription, the sphere for the application of the law will be confined only to a special type of cases--it will be less vague, less open to abuse and enable those who have to administer it to determine objec- tively when a condition has arisen to justify the use of the power vested in them by the law. This, in my opinion, is the true meaning and significance of article 22 (7) (a) and any attempt to whittle it down will lead to deplorable results. Having stated my views as to the construction of article 22 (7) (a), I propose to consider at once whether section 12 of the impugned Act conforms to the requirements of that provision. In my opinion, it does not, because it fails to prescribe either the circumstances or the class or classes of cases in the manner required by the Constitution. It does not prescribe circumstances at all, and, though it purports to prescribe the class or classes, it does so in a manner showing that the true meaning of the provision from which the Parliament derived its power has not been grasped. I have sufficiently dwelt on this part of the case and shall not repeat what I have already said. But I must point out that even if it be assumed that the view advanced by the learned Attorney-General is correct and it was within the competence of Parliament to treat any of the categories mentioned in items 9 and 3 of Lists I and III as constitut- ing a class and to include it without any qualification or change, the impugned section cannot be saved on account of a two-fold error :--. (1) the word ""and"" which links ""class or classes"" with ""circumstances"" in article 22 (7) (a) has been wrongly construed to mean ""or ;"" and (2) the distinction between ""circumstances"" and ""class or classes"" has been completely ignored and they are used as interchangeable terms. The first error appears to me to be quite a serious one, because though the Constitution lays down two require- ments and insists on the prescription of circumstances as well as class or classes, it has been assumed in enacting section 12 that prescription of one of them only will be enough. The other error is still more serious and goes to the root of the matter. There can be no doubt that circumstances and class or classes are two different expressions and have different meanings, but the Act proceeds on the assumption that cir- cumstances are identical with class or classes, as will appear from the words ""any person detained in any of the following classes of cases or under any of the following circumstances"" used in the section. I have already shown how important the specification of circumstances is in legislation of such an extreme and drastic character. There- fore, to confuse ""classes"" with ""circumstances"" and to omit to mention ""circumstances"" at all are in my opinion grave errors. There can, in my opinion, be no escape from the conclusion that section 12 of the Act by which a most impor- tant protection or safeguard conferred on the subject by the Constitution has been taken away, is not a valid provision, since it contravenes the very provision in the Constitution under which the Parliament derived its competence to enact it. I will now briefly deal with article 22 (5) which makes it incumbent on the authority ordering preventive deten- tion to communicate to the person detained the grounds on which the order has been made and to give him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order. It must be remembered that this provision is intended to afford protection to and be a safeguard in Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 62 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 favour of a detained person, and it cannot be read as limiting any rights which he has under the law or any other provisions of the Consti- tution. If article 21 guarantees that before a person is deprived of his liberty he must be allowed an opportunity of establishing his innocence before an impartial tribunal, that right still remains. In point of fact, there is no express exclusion of that right in the Constitution and no prohibition against constituting an impartial tribunal. On the other hand, the right to make a representation which has been granted under the Constitution, must carry with it the right to the representation being properly considered by an impartial person or persons. There must therefore be some machinery for properly examining the cases of the detenus and coming to the conclusion that they have not been de- tained without reason. If this right had been expressly taken away by the Constitution, there would have been an end of the matter, but it has not been expressly taken away, and I am not prepared to read any implicit deprivation of such a valuable right. The mere reference to an advisory board in article 22 (4) (a) does not, if my interpretation of the provision is correct, exclude the constitution of a proper machinery for the purpose of examining the cases of detenus on merits. The constitution of an advisory board for the purpose of reporting whether a person should be detained for more than three months or not is a very different thing from constituting a board for the purpose of reporting whether a man should be detained for a single day. In the view I take, all that Parliament could do under clause (7) (a) of article 22 was to dispense with an advisory board for the purpose contemplated in clause (4) (a) of that article and not to dispense with the proper machinery, by whichever name it may be called, for the purpose of examining the merits of the case of a detained person. It was argued that article 22 is a code by itself and the whole law of preventive detention is to be found within its four corners. I cannot however easily subscribe to this sweeping statement. The article does provide for some mat- ters of procedure, but it does not exhaustively provide for them. It is said that it provides for notice, an opportuni- ty to the detenu to represent his case, an advisory board which may deal with his case, and for the maximum period beyond which a person cannot be detained. These points have undoubtedly been touched, but it cannot be said that they have been exhaustively treated. The right to represent is given, but it is left to the legislature to provide the machinery for dealing with the representation. The advisory board has been mentioned, but it is only to safeguard detention for a period longer than three months. There is ample latitude still left to the Parliament, and if the Parliament makes use of that latitude unreasonably, article 19 (5) may enable the Court to see whether it has transgressed the limits of reasonableness. I will now proceed to deal with the Act in the light of the conclusions I have arrived at. So far as section 3 of the Act is concerned, it was contended that it is most unreasonable, because it throws a citizen at the mercy of certain authorities, who may at their own will order his detention and into whose minds we cannot probe to see wheth- er there is any foundation for the subjective satisfaction upon which their action is to rest. I am however unable to accept this argument. The administrative authorities who have to discharge their responsibilities have to come to quick decisions and must necessarily be left to act on their own judgment. This principle is by no means unreasonable and it underlies all the preventive or quasi administrative measures which are to be found in the Criminal Procedure Code. Under section 107 of that code, it is left to the discretion of the magistrate concerned to determine whether in his opinion there is sufficient ground for proceeding against any person who is likely to occasion a breach of the peace. Under section 145 also, his initial action depends upon his personal satisfaction. Therefore I do not find anything wrong or unconstitutional in section 3 of the Act. But I must point Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 63 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 out that it is a reasonable provision only for the first step, i.e., for arrest and initial detention, and must be followed by some procedure for testing the so- called subjective satisfaction, which can be done only by providing a suitable machinery for examining the grounds on which the order of detention is made and considering the representations of the persons detained in relation to those grounds. I do not also find anything radically wrong in section 7 of the Act, which makes it incumbent on the authority con- cerned to communicate to a detenu the grounds on which the order has been made and to afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representa- tion against the order. Section 10 which provides that the advisory board shall make its report within ten weeks from the date of the detention order is in conformity with arti- cle 22 (4) (a) of the Constitution, and the only comment which one can make is that Parliament was not obliged to fix such a long period for the submission of a report and could have made it shorter in ordinary cases. The real sections which appear to me to offend the Constitution are sections 12 and 14. I have already dealt with the principal objec- tion to section 12, while discussing the provisions of article 22 (7) (a) and I am of the opinion that section 12 does not conform to the provisions of the Constitution and is therefore ultra vires. I also think that even if it be held that it technically complies with the requirements of article 22 (7) (a), Parliament has acted unreasonably in exercising its discretionary power without applying its mind to essential matters and thus depriving the detenus of the safeguard of an advisory board which the Constitution has provided in normal cases. So far as section 14 is con- cerned, all my colleagues have held it to be ultra vires, and, as I agree with the views expressed by them, I do not wish to encumber my judgment by repeating in my own words what has been said so clearly and so well by them. Section 14 may be severable from the other provi- sions of the Act and it may not be possible to grant any relief to the petitioner on the ground that section 14 is invalid. But I think that section 12 goes to the very root of the legislation inasmuch as it deprives a detenu of an essential safeguard, and in my opinion the petitioner is entitled to a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that an essential provision of the Constitution has not been com- plied with. This writ will of course be without prejudice to any action which the authorities may have taken or may hereafter take against the petitioner under the penal law I have to add this qualification because there were allega- tions of his being involved in some criminal cases but the actual facts were not clearly brought out before us. I have only to add a few concluding remarks to my judg- ment. In studying the provisions of the impugned Act, I could not help instituting a comparison in my own mind between it and similar legislation in England during the last two world wars. I could not also help noticing that the impugned Act purports to be a peacetime Act, whereas the legislation to which I have referred was enacted during the war. During the first war as well as the second, a number of persons were detained and a number of cases were brought to Court in connection with their detention, but the two lead- ing cases which will be quoted again and again are Rex v. Halliday (1) and Liversidge v. Sir John Anderson(2). We are aware that in America certain standards which do not conform to ordinary and normal law have been applied by the Judges during the period of the war and sometimes they are compen- dionsly referred to as being included in ""war power."" The two English cases to which I have referred also illustrate the same principle, as will appear from two short extracts which I wish to reproduce. In Rex v. Halliday (3), Lord Atkinson observed as follows :--"" However precious the personal liberty of the subject may be, there is something for which it may Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 64 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 well be, to some extent, sacrificed by legal enactment, namely, national success in the' war, or escape from national plunder or enslavement."" In Liversidge v. Sir John Anderson (4), Lord Macmillan struck the same note in these words :-- ""The liberty which we so 'justly extol is itself the gift of the law and as Magna Charta recognizes may by the law be forfeited or abridged. At a time when it is the undoubted law of the land that a citizen may by conscription or requisition be compelled to give up his life and all that he possesses for his country's cause it may well be no matter for surprise that there should be confided to the Secretary of State a discretionary power of enforcing the relatively mild precaution of detention."" (1) [1917] A.C.260. (3) [1917] A.C. 260atp. 271. [1942] A.C. 206. (4) [1942] A.C. 206 at p. 257. These passages represent the majority view in the two cases, but the very elaborate judgments of Lord Shaw in Rex v. Halliday and that of Lord Atkin in Liversidge v. Sir John Anderson show that there. was room for difference of opinion as well as for a more dispassionate treatment of the case and the points involved in it. It is difficult to say that there is not a good substratum of sound law in the celebrat- ed dictum of Lord Atkin that even amidst the clash of arms the laws are not silent and that they speak the same lan- guage in war as in peace. However that may be, what I find is that in the regulations made in England during the first war as well as the second war there was an elaborate provi- sion for an advisory board in all cases without any excep- tion, which provided a wartime safeguard for persons de- prived of their liberty. There was also a provision in the Act of 1939 that the Secretary of State should report at least once in every month as to the action taken under the regulation including the number of persons detained under orders made thereunder. I find that these reports were printed and made available to the public. I also find that the Secretary of State stated in the House of Commons on the 28th January, 1943, that the general order would be to allow British subjects detained under the Regulation to have consultations with their legal advisers out of the hearing of an officer. This order applied to consultations with barristers and solicitors but not to cases where solicitors sent to interview a detained person a clerk who was not an officer of the High Court. The impugned Act suffers in com- parison, on account of want of such provisions, though, so far as I can see, no great harm was likely to have been caused by setting up a machinery composed of either adminis- trative or judicial authorities for examining the cases of detained persons so as to satisfy the essentials of fairness and justice. The Act also suffers in comparison with some of the later Provincial Acts in which the safeguard of an advisory board is , expressly provided for. I find that there is a provision in section 12 (2) of the Act for the review of the cases of detenus after six months, but this is quite different from examining the merits of the case. The object of such a review is obviously to find out whether by reason of any change in the circumstances, a review of the original order is required. I hope that in pointing out the shortcomings of the Act I will not be misunderstood. I am aware that both in Eng- land and in America and also in many other countries, there has been a reorientation of the old notions of individual freedom which is gradually yielding to social control in many matters. I also realize that those who run the State have very onerous responsibilities, and it is not correct to say that emergent conditions have altogether disappeared from this country. Granting then that Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 65 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 private rights must often be subordinated to the public good, is it not essen- tial in a free community to strike a just balance in the matter ? That a person should be deprived of his personal liberty without a trial is a serious matter, but the needs of society may demand it and the individual may often have to yield to those needs. Still the balance between the maintenance of individual rights and public good can be struck only if the person who is deprived of his liberty is allowed a fair chance to establish his innocence, and I do not see how the establishment of an appropriate machinery giving him such a chance can be an impediment to good and just government. PATANJALI SASTRI J.--This is an application under arti- cle 32 of the Constitution of India for releasing the petitioner from detention in jail without trial under directions purporting to be issued by the Government of Madras under the Preventive Detention Act, 1950, and it has the distinction of being the first application invoking the guaranteed protection of this Court as the guardian of Fundamental Rights against alleged infringement of the petitioner's right to freedom of movement. As the case involved issues of great public importance and breaking of new ground it was argued with thoroughness and ability on both sides, reference being made to more or less analogous provisions of the Constitutions of other countries and in particular the Constitution of the United States of America. The petitioner had been under detention previously under orders passed by the said Government under the Madras Main- tenance of Public Order Act, 1947, but as the validity of that Act and all other similar local public safety enact- ments had been questioned in some of the High Courts in India after the new Constitution came into force, the Par- liament enacted a comprehensive measure called the Preven- tive Detention Act, 1950, (hereinafter referred to as the impugned Act) extending to the whole of India with a certain exception not material here. The Act came into force on 25th February 1950, and, on the 27th February, the Government of Madras, in purported exercise of the powers conferred by the impugned Act and in supersession of earlier orders, directed the detention of the petitioner, and the order was served on him on 1st March. The petitioner contends that the impugned Act and in particular sections 3, 7, 10, 11, 19,, 13 and 14 thereof take away or abridge the fundamental right to freedom of movement in contravention of article 13 (2) of the Constitu- tion and is, therefore, void as declared therein. Article 13 is one of a fasciculus of articles which are comprised in part III of the Indian Constitution headed ""Fundamental Rights."" This Part forms a new feature of the Constitution and is the Indian ""Bill of Rights."" It is modelled on the first ten Amendments of the American Con- stitution which declare the fundamental rights of the American citizen. Article 12, which is the first article in this Part, defines ""the State"" as including the Governments and Legislatures of the Union and the States as well as all local and other authorities against which the fundamental rights are enforceable, and article 13 (1) declares that all existing laws inconsistent with the provisions of Part III shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void. Clause (2) of the article, on which the petitioner's con- tention is primarily founded reads as follows: ""The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void."" Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 66 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 As the constitutional inhibition against deprivation or abridgement relates only to ""the rights conferred by this Part,"" it is necessary first to ascertain the nature and extent of the right which, according to the petitioner, Part III has conferred on him, and, secondly, to determine wheth- er the right so ascertained has been taken away or abridged by the impugned Act or by any of its provisions. The first question turns on the proper interpretation of the relevant articles of the Constitution, and the second involves the consideration of the provisions of the impugned Act. Mr. Nambiar appearing for the petitioner advanced three main lines of argument. In the first place, the right to move freely throughout the territory of India referred to in article 19 (1)(d) is of the very essence of personal liber- ty, and inasmuch as the detention authorised by the impugned Act was not a ""reasonable restriction"" which Parliament could validly impose on such right under clause (5) of the article, the impugned Act is void. Alternatively, the petitioner had a fundamental right under article 21 not to be deprived of his personal liberty except according to procedure established by law, and the impugned Act by autho- rising detention otherwise than in accordance with proper procedure took away that right and was therefore void. And, lastly, the provisions of the impugned Act already re- ferred to were ultra vires and inoperative as Parliament in enacting them has overstepped the ]imitations placed on its legislative power by article 22 clauses (4) to (7). Accordingly, the first question for consideration is whether article 19 (1) (d) and (5) is applicable to the present case. ""Liberty,"" says John Stuart Mill, ""consists in doing what one desires. But the liberty' of the individual must be thus far limited--he must not make him- self a nuisance to others."" Man, as a rational being, desires to do many things, but in a civil society his de- sires have to be controlled, regulated and reconciled with the exercise of similar desires. by other individuals. Liberty has, therefore, to be limited in order to be effectively possessed. Accordingly, article 19, while guaranteeing some of the most valued phases or elements of liberty to every citizen as civil1 rights, pro- vides for their regulation for the common good by the State imposing certain ""restrictions"" on their exercise. The power of locomotion is no doubt an essential element of personal liberty which means freedom from bodily restraint, and detention in jail is a drastic invasion of that liberty. But the question is: Does article 19, in its setting in Part III of the Constitution, deal with the deprivation of per- sonal liberty in the sense of incarceration ? Sub-clause (d) of clause (1) does not refer to freedom of movement simplic- iter but guarantees the right to move freely ""throughout the territory of India."" Sub-clause (e) similarly guaran- tees the right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India. And clause (5) authorises the imposi- tion of ""reasonable restrictions"" on these rights in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe. Reading these provisions together, it is reasonably clear that they were designed primarily to emphasise the factual unity of the territory of India and to secure the right of a free citizen to move from one place in India to another and to reside and settle in any part of India unhampered by any barriers which nar- row-minded provincialism may seek to interpose. The use of the word ""restrictions"" in the various sub-clauses seems to imply, in the context, that the rights guaranteed by the article are still capable of being exercised, and to exclude the idea of incarceration though the words ""restriction"" and ""deprivation"" are sometimes used as interchangeable terms, as restriction may reach a point where it may well amount to deprivation. Read as a whole and viewed in its setting among the group of provisions (articles 19-22) relating to ""Right to -Freedom,"" article 19 seems to my mind to pre--suppose that Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 67 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 the citizen to whom the possession of these fundamental rights is secured retains the substratum of personal freedom on which alone the enjoyment of these rights necessarily rests. It was said that subclause (f) would militate against this view, as the enjoyment of the right ""to acquire, hold and dispose of property"" does not depend upon the owner retaining his personal freedom. This assumption is obviously wrong as regards moveable proper- ties, and even as regards immoveables he could not acquire or dispose of them from behind the prison bars; nor could he ""hold"" them in the sense of exercising rights of possession and control over them which is what the word seems to mean in the context. But where, as a penalty for committing a crime or otherwise, the citizen is lawfully deprived of his freedom, there could no longer be any ques- tion of his exercising or enforcing the rights referred to in clause (1). Deprivation of personal liberty in such a situation is not, in my opinion, within the purview of article 19 at all but is dealt with by the succeeding arti- cles 20 and 21. In other words, article 19 guarantees to the citizens the enjoyment of certain civil liberties while they are free, while articles 20-22 secure to all persons--citizens and non-citizens--certain constitutional guarantees in regard to punishment and prevention of crime. Different criteria are provided by which to measure legisla- tive judgments in the two fields, and a construction which would bring within article 19 imprisonment in punishment of a crime committed or in prevention of a crime threatened would, as it seems to me, make a reductio ad absurdum of that provision. If imprisonment were to be regarded as a ""restriction"" of the right mentioned in article 19 (1)(d), it would equally be a restriction on the rights mentioned by the other subclauses of clause (1), with the result that all penal laws providing for imprisonment as a mode of punish- ment would have to run the gauntlet of clauses (2) to (6) before their validity could be accepted. For instance,the law which imprisons for theft would, on that view, fall to be justified under clause (2) as a law sanctioning restric- tion of freedom of speech and expression. Indeed, a Divi- sion Bench of the Allahabad High Court,in a recent unreport- ed decision brought to our notice applied the test of undermining the security of the State or tending to overthrow it in determining the validity or otherwise of the impugned Act. The learned Judges construed article 19 as covering cases of deprivation of personal liberty and held, logically enough, that inasmuch as the impugned Act, by authorising preventive detention, infringed the right to freedom of speech and expression, its validity should be judged by the reservations in clause (2), and, as it failed to stand that test, it was unconstitutional and void. Mr. Nambiar did not seek to go so far. He drew a dis- tinction between the right conferred by sub-clause (d) and those conferred by the other sub-clauses. He urged, refer- ring to Blackstone's Commentaries, that personal liberty consisted ""in moving one's person to whatever place one's inclination might direct,"" and that any law which de- prived a person of such power of locomotion was a direct invasion of the right mentioned in sub-clause (d), whereas it inter-fered only indirectly and consequentially with the rights mentioned in the other sub Clauses. There is no substance in the distinction suggested. It would be illogi- cal, in construing article 19, to attribute to one of the sub-clauses a scope and effect totally different from the scope and effect of the others or to draw a distinc-. tion between one right and another in the group. All the rights mentioned in clause (1) are equally essential elements in the liberty of the individual in any civilised and democrat- ic community, and imprison, ment operates as an extinction of all of them alike. It cannot, therefore, be said that deprivation of personal liberty is an infringement of the right conferred by sub-clause (d) alone but not of the others. The learned Judges of the Allahabad High Court realised this and were perfectly logical in holding that the constitutional validity of a law providing for deprivation of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 68 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 personal liberty or imprisonment must be judged by the tests laid down not only in clause (5) of article 19 but also in the other clauses including clause (2), though their major premise that deprivation of personal liberty was a ""restriction"" within the meaning of article 19 is, in my judgment, erroneous. It was said that preventive detention being a drasic re- striction of the right to move freely was, in its pith and substance,"" within article 19 (1) (d) read with clause (5) and not within article 21 which deals with crime and its punishment and prevention. There is no room here, in my opinion, for the application of the rule of ""pith and sub- stance."" As pointed out by the Privy Council in Prafulla Kumar Mukherjee v. The Bank of Commerce Ltd., Khulna (1), approving the observations of the Federal Court in Subrah- manyam Chettiar v. Muttuswamy Goundan (2), the rule was evolved by the Board for determining whether an impugned statute was, in its true character, legislation with respect to matters within the jurisdiction of one legislature or another in a scheme of divided legislative power. No such question arises here. What the Court has to ascertain is the true scope and meaning of article 19 in the context of Part III of the Constitution, in order to decide whether depriva- tion of personal liberty falls within that article, and the pith and substance rule will be more misleading than helpful in the decision of that issue. Article 19, as I have already indicated, guarantees protection for the more important civil liberties of citizens who are in the enjoyment of their freedom, while at the same time laying down the re- strictions which the legislature may properly impose on the exercise of such rights, and it has nothing to do with deprivation of personal liberty or imprisonment which is dealt with by the succeeding three articles. There is also another consideration which points to the same conclusion. The ]Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly, to whose Report reference was freely made by both sides during the argument, recommended ""that the word liber- ty should be qualified by the insertion of the word 'person- al ' before it, for otherwise it might be construed very widely so as to include even the freedoms already dealt with in article 13"" (now article 19). The acceptance of this suggestion shows that whatever may be the generally accepted (1) 74 I.A. 23. (2) [1940] F.C.E. 188. connotation of the expression ""personal liberty,"" it was used in article 21 in a sense which excludes the freedoms dealt with in article 19, that is to say, personal liberty in the context of Part III of the Constitution is something distinct from the freedom to move freely throughout the territory of India. It was further submitted that article 19 declared the substantive rights of personal liberty while article 21 provided the procedural safeguard against their deprivation. This view of the correlation between the two articles has found favour with some of the Judges in the High Courts which have had occasion to consider the constitutional validity of the impugned Act. It is, however, to be ob- served that article 19 confers the rights therein specified only on the citizens of India, while article 21 extends the protection of life and personal liberty to all persons--citizens and noncitizens alike. Thus, the two articles do not operate in a conterminous field, and this is one reason for rejecting the correlation suggested. Again, if article 21 is to be understood as providing only proce- dural safeguards, where is the substantive right to personal liberty of non-citizens to be found in the Constitution ? Are they denied such right altogether ? If they are to have no right of personal liberty, why is the proce- dural safeguard in article 21 exended to them ? And where is that most fundamental right of all, the right to life, provided for in the Constitution ? The truth is that arti- cle Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 69 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 21, like its American prototype in the Fifth and Four- teenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States, presents an example of the fusion of procedural and substan- tive rights in the same provision. The right to live, though the most fundamental of all, is also one of the most difficult to define and its protection generally takes the form of a declaration that no person shall be deprived of it save by due process of law or by authority of law. ""Process"" or ""procedure"" in this context connotes both the act and the manner of proceeding to take away a man's life or per- sonal liberty. And the first and essential step in a proce- dure established by law for such deprivation must be a law made by a competent legislature Authorising such deprivation. This brings me to the consid- eration of articles 21 and 22 to which was deroted the greater part of the debate at the Bar. These articles run as follows: ""21. No person shall be deprived of his life or person- al liberty except according to procedure established by law. 22. (1) No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest, nor shall he be denied the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice. (2) Every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate. (3) Nothing in clauses '(1) and (2) shall apply (a) to any person who for the time being is an enemy alien; or (b) to any person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention. (4) No law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless- (a) an Advisory Board consisting of persons who, are, or have been, or are qualified to be appointed as, Judges of a High Court has reported before the expiration of the said period of three months that there is in its opinion suffi- cient cause for such detention: Provided that nothing in this sub-clause shall' autho- rise the detention of any person beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by parliament under sub-clause Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 70 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 (b) of clause (7); or (b) such person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by Parliament under sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (7). (5) When any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for preventive detention, the authority making the order shall, as soon as may be, commu- nicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order. (6) Nothing in clause (5) shall require the authority making any such order as is referred to in that clause to disclose facts which such authority considers to be against the public interest to disclose. (7) Parliament may by law prescribe (a) the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preven- tive detention without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause (a) of clause (4); (b) the maximum period for which any person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law provid- ing for preventive detention; and (c) the procedure to be followed by an Advisory Board in an inquiry under sub-clause (a) of clause (4)."" Mr. Nambiar urged that the word ""law"" in article 21 should be understood, not in the sense of an enactment but as signifying the immutable and universal principles of natural justice--the jus naturale of the civil law--and that the expression ""procedure established by law"" meant the same thing as that famous phrase ""due process of law"" in the American Constitution in its procedural aspect. Numerous American decisions were cited to show that the phrase implied the basic requirements of (1) an objective and ascertainable standard of conduct to which it is possi- ble to conform, (2) notice to the party of the accusation against him, (3) a reasonable opportunity for him to estab- lish his innocence, and (4) an impartial tribunal capable of giving an unbiased judgment Mr. Nambiar conceded that these requirements might have to be modified or adapted to suit the nature of the particular proceeding and the object it had in view, as for instance, in a case of preventive detention, previous notice, which might result in the person concerned going underground might be dispensed with Learned counsel insisted that these requirements, being the very core of the principles of natural justice which transcended all State- made laws, must be substantially Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 71 A.K.

He also appealed to the Pream- ble of the Constitution as the guiding star in its interpre- tation to support his thesis that, in view of the democratic Constitution which the people of India have purported to give themselves guaranteeing to the citizens certain funda- mental rights which are justiciabke, the provisions of Part III must be construed as being paramount to the legislative will, as otherwise the socalled fundamental right to life and personal liberty would have no protection against legis- lative action, and article 13 12) would be rendered nugato- ry. There can be no doubt that the people of India have, in exercise of their sovereign will as expressed in the Pream- ble, adopted the democratic ideal which assures to the citizen the dignity of the individual and other cherished human values as a means to the full evolution and expression of his personality, and in delegating to the legislature, the executive and the judiciary their respective powers in the Constitution, reserved to themselves certain fundamental rights, socalled, I apprehend, because they have been re- tained by the people and made paramount to the delegated powers, as in the American model. Madison (who played a prominent part in framing the First Amendment of the Ameri- can Constitution) pointing out the distinction, due to historical reasons, between the American and the British ways of securing ""the great and essential rights of the people,"" observed ""Here they are secured not by laws para- mount to prerogative but by Constitutions paramount to laws:"" Report on the Virginia Resolutions, quoted in Near v. Minnesota (1). (1) 283 U.S. 697. This has been translated into positive law in Part III of the Indian Constitution, and I agree that in construing these provisions the high purpose and spirit of the Preamble as well as the constitutional significance of a Declaration of Fundamental Rights should be borne in mind. This, howev- er, is not to say that the language of the provisions should be stretched to square with this or that constitutional theory in disregard of the cardinal rule of interpretation of any enactment, constitutional or other, that its spirit, no less than its intendment should be collected primarily from the natural meaning of the words used. Giving full effect to these principles, however, I am unable to agree that the term ""law"" in article 21 means the immutable and universal principles of natural justice. ""Procedure established by law"" must be taken to refer to a procedure which has a statutory origin, for no procedure is known or can be said to have been established by such vague and uncertain concepts as ""the immutable and universal principles of natural justice."" In my opinion, ""law"" in article 21 means ""positive or State-made law."" Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 72 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 No doubt, the American Judges have adopted the other connotation in their interpretation of the due process clause in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Ameri- can Constitution ("" Nor shall any person be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law ""). But that clause has an evolutionary history behind it. The phrase has been traced back to 28 Edw. III Ch. 3, and Coke in his Institutes identified the term with the expression ""the law of the land"" in the Great Charter of John. Even in England where the legislative omnipotence of Parliament is now firmly established, Coke understood these terms as implying an inherent limitation on all legislation,and ruled in Dr. Bonham's Case (1) that ""the common law will control Acts of Parliament and sometimes adjudge them to be utterly void when they are against common right and reason."" Though this doctrine was later discarded in England as being ""a warning (1) 8 Rep. 118 (a). rather than an authority to be followed"" [per Willes J. in Lee v. Dude and Torrington Ry. (1)] it gained ground m America, at first as a weapon in the hands of the Revolu- tionists with which to resist the laws of Parliament, and later as an instrument in the hands of the Judges for estab- lishing the supremacy of the judiciary [see Calder v. Bull (""')]. In the latter half of the 19th century, this doc- trine of a transcendental common law or natural justice was absorbed in the connotation of the phrase ""due process of law"" occurring in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. By laying emphasis on the word"" due,"" interpreting ""law"" as the fundamental principles of natural justice and giving the words ""liberty"" and ""property"" their widest meaning, the Judges have made the due process clause into a general restriction on all legislative power. And when that power was threatened with prostration by the excesses of due process, the equally vague and expansive doctrine of ""police power,"" i.e., the power of Government to regulate private rights in public interest, was evolved to counteract such excesses. All this has been criticised as introducing great uncertainty in the state of the law in that country, for no one could be sure how due process of law would affect a particular enactment. A century after the phrase had been the subject of judicial interpretation one learned Judge observed in 1877 that it was incapable of precise definition and that its intent and application could only be ascer- tained by ""the gradual process of inclusion and exclusion"" [Davidson v. New Orleans (3)]and, as recently as 1948, another Judge referred to the difficulty of ""giving defi- niteness to the vague contours of due process"" and ""of spinning judgment upon State action out of that gossamer concept:"" Haley v. State of Ohio (4). It is not a matter for surprise, therefore, that the Drafting Committee appointed by the Constituent Assembly of India recommended the substitution of the expression ""except according to procedure (1) (1871) L.R. 6 C.P. 576, 582. (3) 96 U.S. 97. (1798) 3 Dallas 386. (4) 332 U.S. 596. established by law"" taken from the Japanese Constitution, 1946, for the words ""without due process of law"" which occurred in the original draft, ""as the former is more specific."" In their Report the Committee added that they have ""attempted to make these rights (fundamental rights) and the. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 73 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 limitations to which they must necessarily be subject as definite as possible, since the Courts may have to pronounce upon them"" (para. 5). In the face of all these considerations, it is difficult to accept the suggestion that ""law"" in. article 21 stands for the jus naturale of the civil law, and that the phrase ""according to procedure established by law"" is equivalent to due process of law in its procedural aspect, for that would have the effect of introducing into our Constitution those ""subtle and elusive criteria"" implied in that phrase which it was the deliberate purpose of the framers of our Constitution to avoid. On the other hand, the interpretation suggested by the Attorney-General on behalf of the intervener that the ex- pression means nothing more than procedure prescribed by any law made by a competent legislature is hardly more accept- able. ""Established"" according to him, means prescribed, and if Parliament or the Legislature of a State enacted a proce- dure, however novel and ineffective for affording the ac- cused person a fair opportunity of defending himself, it would be sufficient for depriving a person of his life or personal liberty. He submitted that the Constituent Assem- bly definitely rejected the doctrine of judicial supremacy When it rejected the phrase ""due process of law"" and made the legislative will unchallengeable, provided only ""some procedure"" was laid down. The Indian Constitution having thus preferred the English doctrine of Parliamentary supremacy, the phrase ""procedure established by law"" must be construed in accordance with the English view of due process of law, that is to say, any procedure which Parliament may choose to prescribe. Learned counsel drew attention to the speeches made by several members of the Assembly on the floor of the House for explaining, as he put it, the ""his- torical background."" A speech made in the course of the debate on a bill could at best be indicative of the subjective intent of the speaker, but it could not reflect the inarticulate mental processes lying behind the majority vote which carried the bill. Nor is it reasonable to assume that the minds of all those legislators were in accord. The Court could only search for the objec- tive intent of the legislature primarily in the words used in the enactment, aided by such historical material as reports of statutory committees, preambles etc. I attach no importance, therefore, to the speeches made by some of the members of the Constituent Assembly in the course of the debate on article 15 (now article 21). The main difficulty I feel in accepting the construction suggested by the Attorney-General is that it completely stultifies article 13 (2) and, indeed, the very conception of a fundamental right. It is of the essence of that con- ception that it is protected by the fundamental law of the Constitution against infringement by ordinary legislation. It is not correct to say that the Constitution has adopted the doctrine of Parliamentary supremacy. So far, at any rate, as Part III is concerned, the Constitution, as I have already observed, has accepted the American view of funda- mental rights. The provisions of articles 13 and 32 make this reasonably clear. Could it then have been the inten- tion of the framers of the Constitution that the most impor- tant fundamental rights to life and personal liberty should be at the mercy of legislative majorities as, in effect, they would be if ""established"" were to mean merely ""pre- scribed ?"" In other words, as an American Judge said in a similar context, does the constitutional prohibition in article 13 (2) amount to no more than ""You shall not take away life or personal freedom unless you choose to take it away,"" which is mere verbiage. It is no sound answer to say that, if article 21 conferred no right immune from legisla- tive invasion, there would be no question of contravening article 13 (2). The argument seems, to my mind, to beg the question, for it assumes that the article affords no such immunity. It is said that article 21 affords no protection against competent legislative action in the field of substantive Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 74 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 criminal law, for there is no provision for judicial review, on the ground of reasonable- ness or otherwise, of such laws, as in the case of the rights enumerated in article 19. Even assuming it to be so the construction of the learned Attorney. General would have the effect of rendering wholly ineffective and illusory even the procedural protection which the article was un- doubtedly designed to afford. It was argued that ""law"" in article 31 which provides that no person shall be deprived of his property ""save by authority of law"" must mean enacted law and that if a person's property could be taken away by legislative action, his right to life and personal liberty need not enjoy any greater immunity. The analogy is mis- leading. Clause (2) of article 31 provides for payment of compensation and that right is justiciable except in the two cases mentioned in clauses (4) and (6) which are of a tran- sitory character. The constitutional safeguard of the right to property in the said article is, therefore, not so illu- sory or ineffective as clause (1) by itself might make it appear, even assuming that"" law"" there means ordinary legis- lation. Much reliance was placed on the Irish case The King v. The Military Governor of Hare Park Camp (1) where the Court held that the term ""law"" in article 6 of the Irish Constitu- tion of 1922 which provides that ""the liberty of the person is inviolable and no person shall be deprived of his liberty except in accordance with law"" meant a law enacted by the Parliament, and that therefore the Public Safety Act of 1924 did not contravene the Constitution. The Court followed The King v. Halliday(2) where the House of Lords by a majority held that the Defence of the Realm (Consolidation) Act, 1914, and the Regulations framed thereunder did not infringe upon the Habeas Corpus Acts and the Magna Carta ""for the simple reason that the Act and the Orders become part of the law of the land."" But that was because, as Lord Dunedin pointed out ""the British Constitution has entrusted to the two Houses of parliament subject to the assent (1) [19241 2 I.R. 104. (2) [1917] A.C. 260. of the King, an absolute power untrammelled by any written instrument obedience to which may be compelled by some judicial body,"" whereas the Irish Constitution restricted the legislative powers of the Irish Parliament by a formal declaration of funda mental rights and by providing for a judicial review of legislation in contravention of the Constitution (article 65). This radical distinction was overlooked. The Attorney-General further submitted that, even on his interpretation, article 21 would be a protection against violation of the rights by the executive and by individuals, an d that would be sufficient justification for the article ranking as a fundamental safeguard. There is no substance in the suggestion. As pointed out in Eshugbayi Eleko v. Gov- ernment of Nigeria (Officer Administering) (1), the execu- tive could only act in pursuance of the powers given by law and no constitutional protection against such action is really needed. Even in monarchical Britain the struggle between prerogative and law has long since ended in favour of the latter. ""In accordance with British jurisprudence"" said Lord Atkin in the case cited above, ""no member of the executive can interfere with the liberty or property of a British subject except on the condition that he can support the legality of his action before a Court of justice."" As for protection against individuals, it is a misconception to think that constitutional safeguards are directed against individuals. They are as a rule directed against the State and its organs. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 75 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 Protection against violation of the rights by individuals must be sought in the ordinary law. It is therefore difficult to accept the suggestion that article 21 was designed to afford protection only against infringements by the executive or individuals. On the other hand,the insertion of a declaration of Fundamental Rights in the forefront of the Constitution, coupled with an express prohibition against legislative interference with these rights (article 13) and the provision of a constitutional sanction for the enforcement of such prohibition by means of a judicial review (article 32) is, in my (1) [1931] A.C. 662. opinion, a clear and emphatic indication that these rights are to be paramount to ordinary State-made laws. After giving the matter my most careful and anxious consideration, I have come to the conclusion that there are only two possible solutions of the problem. In the first place, a satisfactory via media between the two extreme positions contended for on either side may be found by stressing the word ""established"" which implies some degree of firmness, permanence and general acceptance, while it does not exclude origination by statute. ""Procedure estab- lished by law"" may well be taken to mean what the Privy Council referred to in King Emperor v. Benoari Lal Sharma (1) as ""the ordinary and well-established criminal proce- dure,"" that is to say, those settled usages and normal modes of proceeding sanctioned by the Criminal Procedure Code which is the general law of criminal procedure in the coun- try. Their Lordships were referring to the distinction between trial by special Courts provided by an Ordinance of the Governor-General and trial by ordinary Courts under the Criminal Procedure Code. It can be no objection to this view that the Code prescribes no single and uniform proce- dure for all types of cases but provides varying procedures for different classes of cases. Certain basic principles emerge as the constant factors common to all those proce- dures, and they form the core of the procedure established by law. I realise that even on this view, the life and liberty of the individual will not be immune from legisla- tive interference, for a competent legislature may change the procedure so as to whittle down the protection if so minded. But, in the view I have indicated, it must not be a change ad hoc for any special purpose or occasion, but a change in the general law of procedure embodied in the Code. So long as such a change is not effected, the protection under article 21 would be available. The different measures of constitutional protection which the fundamental right to life and personal liberty will enjoy under article 21 as interpreted in the three ways (1) [1945] F.C.R. 161,175. referred to above will perhaps be best illustrated by a concrete example. Suppose that article 22 (1) was not there and Parliament passed an Act, as a temporary measure, taking away in certain cases the right of an accused person to be defended by a legal practitioner. According to the petition- er's learned counsel the Act would be void as being contrary to the immutable principles of natural justice embodied in article 21, whereas on the construction contended for by the Attorney-General, the Act would be perfectly valid, while, on the view I have indicated above, the Act would be bad, but if the denial of such right of defence is made a normal feature of the ordinary law of criminal procedure by abro- gating section 340 (1)of the Code, article 21 would be powerless to protect against such legislative action. But in a free democratic republic such a drastic change in the normal law of procedure, though theoretically possi- ble, would be difficult to bring about, and that practical difficulty will be the measure of the protection afforded by article 21. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 76 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 It was said that the safeguards provided in clauses (1) and (2) of article 22 are more or less covered by the provisions of the Criminal Procedure' Code, and this overlapping would have been avoided if article 21 were intended to bear the construction as indicated above. The argument overlooks that, while the provisions of the Code would be liable to alteration by competent legislative action, the safeguards in clauses (1)and (2) of article 22, being constitutional, could not be similarly dealt with: and this sufficiently explains why those safeguards find a place in the Constitution. The only alternative to the construction I have indi- cated above, if a constitutional transgression is to be avoided, would be to interpret the reference to ""law"" as implying a constitutional amendment pro tanto, for it is only a law enacted by the procedure provided for such amend- ment (article 368) that could modify or override a fundamen- tal right without contravening article 13 (2). The question next arises as to how far the protection under article 21, such as it has been found to be, is avail- able to persons under preventive detention. The learned Attorney-General contended that article 21 did not apply to preventive detention at all, as article 22 clauses (4) to (7) formed a complete code of constitutional safeguards in respect of preventive detention,and, provided only these provisions are conformed to, the validity of any law relat- ing to preventive detention could not be challenged. I am unable to agree with this view. The language of article 21 is perfectly general and covers deprivation of personal liberty or incarceration, both for punitive and preventive reasons. If it was really the intention of the framers of the Constitution to exclude the application of article 21 to cases of preventive detention, nothing would have been easier than to add a reference to article 21 in clause (3) of article 22 which provides that clauses (1) and (2) of the latter shall not apply to any person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention Nor is there anything in the language of clauses (4) to (7) of article 22 leading necessarily to the inference that article 21 is inapplicable to preventive detention. These clauses deal only with certain aspects of preventive deten- tion such as the duration of such detention, the constitu- tion of an advisory board for reviewing the order of deten- tion in certain cases, the communication of the grounds of detention to the person detained and the provision of an opportunity to him of making a representation against the order. It cannot be said that these provisions form an exhaustive code dealing with all matters relating to preven- tive detention and cover the entire area of protection which article 21, interpretedin the sense I have indicated above, would afford to the person detained. I am, therefore, of opinion that article 21 is applicable to preventive deten- tion as well. I will now proceed to examine whether the impugned Act or any of its provisions under which the petitioner has been ordered to be detained, takes away any of the rights con- ferred by articles 21 and 22 or infringes the protection afforded thereby. The outstanding fact to be borne in mind in this connection is that preventive detention has been given a constitutional status. This sinister-looking feature, so strangely out of place in a democratic constitution which invests personal liberty with the sacrosanctity of a fundamental right and so incompatible with the promises of its preamble is doubtless designed to prevent an abuse of freedom by anti-sOcial and subversive elements which might imperil the national welfare of the infant Republic. It is in this spirit that clauses (3) to (7) of article 22 should, in my opinion, be con- strued and harmonised as far as possible with article 21 so as not to diminish unnecessarily the protection afforded for the legitimate exercise of personal liberty. In the first place, as already stated, clause (3) of article 22 excludes a, person detained under Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 77 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 any law providing for preventive detention from the benefit of the safeguards provided in clauses (1) and (2) No doubt clause (5) of the same article makes some amends for the deprivation of these safeguards in that it provides for the communication to the person detained the grounds on which the order has been made and for an opportunity being afforded to him of making a representation against the order, but the important right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice is gone. Similarly, the prohibition against detention in custody beyond a period of 24 hours without the authority of a magistrate has also been taken away m cases of preventive detention. It was not disputed that, to the extent to which the express provisions of clauses (4) to (7) authorised the abrogation or abridgement of the safeguards provided under other articles or substitution of other safeguards in a modified form, those express provisions must rule. Of the four essentials of the due process on which Mr. Nambiar insisted, (which also form part of the ordinary and established procedure under the Criminal Procedure Code, though I cannot agree that they are immutable and beyond legislative change) the requirements of notice and an opportunity to establish his innocence must, as already stated, be taken to have been provided for by clause (5)of article 22. As for an ascertainable standard of conduct to which it is possible to conform, article 22 makes no specific provision in cases of preventive detention, and if such a safeguard can be said to be implicit in the procedure established by law in the sense explained above in preventive detention cases, it could no doubt be invoked. This point will be considered presently in dealing with provisions of the impugned Act. The only other essential requirement, and the most essen- tial of all, is an impartial tribunal capable of giving an unbiassed verdict. This, Mr. Nambiar submitted, was left unprovided for by article 22, the advisory board referred to in clause (4) (a) being, according to him, intended to deal solely with the question of duration of the detention, that is to say, whether or not there was sufficient cause for detaining the person concerned for more than three months, and not with judging whether the person detained was innocent. A tribunal which could give an unbiassed judg- ment on that issue was an essential part of the protection afforded by article21 in whichever way it may be interpret- ed, and reference was made in this connection to the preven- tive provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (Ch. VIII). The impugned Act, not having provided for such a tribunal contravened article 21 and was therefore void. It will be seen that the whole of this argument is based on the major premise that the advisory board mentioned in clause (4) (a) of article 22 is not a tribunal intended to deal with the issue of justification of detention. Is that view correct? It was argued that the words ""sufficient cause for such detention"" in sub-clause (a) of clause (4) had reference to the detention beyond three months mentioned in clause (4) and that this view was supported by the language of sub- clause (a) of clause (7) whereby Parliament is authorised to prescribe the circumstances under'which and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months without the opinion of an advisory board. In other words, learned counsel submitted, the combined effect of clauses (4) and (7) was that no person could be detained for a period over three months without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board that there was sufficient cause for detention for the longer period, except in cases where Parliament passed a law autho- rising detention for such period even without the opinion of an advisory board. Thus, these two clauses were concerned solely with the duration of the preventive detention, and so was the advisory board which those clauses provided for that purpose. I am unable to accept this view. I am inclined to think that the words ""such detention"" in sub-clause (a) refer back to the preventive detention mentioned in clause (4) and not to detention for a longer period than three months. An advisory board, composed as it has to be of Judges or lawyers, would hardly be in a Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 78 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 position to judge how long a person under preventive detention, say, for reasons connected with defence, should be detained. That must be a matter for the executive authorities, the Depart- ment of Defence, to determine, as they alone are responsible for the defence of the country and have the necessary data for taking a decision on the point. All that an advisory board can reasonably be asked to do, as a safeguard against the misuse of the power, is to judge whether the detention is justified and not arbitrary or mala fide. The -fact that the advisory board is required to make its report before the expiry of three months and so could submit it only a day or two earlier cannot legitimately lead to an inference that the board was solely concerned with the issue whether or not the detention should continue beyond that period. Before any such tribunal could send in its report a reasonable time must elapse, as the grounds have to be communicated to the person detained, he has to make his representation to the detaining authority which has got to be placed before the board through the appropriate departmental channel. Each of these steps may, in the course Of official routine, take some time, and 'three months' period might well have been thought a reasonable period to allow before the board could be-required to submit its report. Assuming, however, that the words ""such detention"" had reference to the period of detention, there is no apparent reason for confining the enquiry by the advisory board to the sole issue of duration beyond three months without reference to the question as to whether the detention was justified or not. Indeed, if is difficult to conceive how a tribunal could fairly judge whether a person should be detained for more than three months without at the same time considering whether there was sufficient cause for the detention at all. I am of opinion that the advisory board referred to in clause (4) is the machinery devised by the Constitution for reviewing orders for preventive detention in certain cases on a consideration of the representations made by the persons detained. This is the view on which Parliament has proceeded in enacting the impugned Act as will be seen from sections 9 and 10 thereof, and I think it is the correct view. It follows that the petitioner cannot claim to have his case judged by any other impartial tribu- nal by virtue of article 21 or otherwise. Mr. Nambiar, however, objected that, on this view, a law could authorise preventive detention for three months with- out providing for review by any tribunal, and for even longer periods if Parliament passed an Act such as is con- templated in sub-clause (a) of clause (7). That may be so, but, however deplorable such a result may be from the point of view of the person detained, there could be no remedy if, on a proper construction of clauses (4) and (7), the Consti- tution is found to afford no higher protection for the personal liberty of the individual. Turning next to the provisions of the impugned Act, whose constitutional validity was challenged, it will be necessary to consider only those provisions which affect the petitioner before us. In the first place, it was contended that section 3, which empowers the Central Government or the State Government to detain any person if it is ""satisfied"" that it is necessary to do so with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to (among other things) the security of the State or the maintenance of public order, cannot be said to comply with the procedure established by law, as the section prescribes no objective and ascertainable standard of conduct to which it will be possible to conform, but leaves it to the will and pleasure of the Government concerned to make an order of detention. TIm argument proceeds on the assumption that the procedure established by law is equivalent to the due process of law. I have already endeavoured to show that it is not Apart Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 79 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 from this, the argument overlooks that for the purposes of preventive detention it would be difficult, if not impossi- ble to lay down objective rules of conduct failure to conform to which should lead to such detention. As tim very term implies, the detention in such cases is effected with a view to prevent the person concerned from acting prejudi- cially to certain objects which the legislation providing for such detention has in view. Nor would it be practicable to indicate or enumerate in advance what acts or classes of acts would be regarded as prejudicial. The responsibility for the security of the State and the maintenance of public order etc. having been laid on the executive Government it must naturally be left to that Government to exercise the power of preventive detention whenever they think the occa- sion demands it. Section 12 came in for a good deal of criticism. That section, which governs the duration of thepetitioner's detention reads as follows :-- ""Duration of detention in certain cases.--Any person detained in any of the following classes of cases or under any of the following circumstances may be detained without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board for a period longer than three months, but not exceeding one year from the date of his detention, namely, where such person has been detained with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to:-- (a) the defence of India, relations of India with for- eign powers or the security of India; or (b) the security of a State of the maintenance of public order. (2) The case of every person detained under a detention order to which the provisions of sub-section (1) apply shall, within a period of six months from the date of his detention, be reviewed where the order was made by the Central Government or a State Government, by such Govern- ment, and where the order was made by any officer specified in sub-section (2)of section 3, by the State Government to which such officer is subordinate, in consultation with a person who is, or has been, or is qualified to be appointed as a Judge of a High Court nominated in that behalf by the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be."" It was urged that this did not comply with the require- ments of clause (7) of article 22 as it merely repeated the ""matters"" or legislative topics mentioned in Entry 9 of List I and Entry 3 of List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. What Parliament has to do under clause(7) of article 22 is to prescribe ""the circumstances under which and the class or classes of cases in which"" a person may be detained for a period longer than three months without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board. It was said that clause (4) (a) provided for ordinary cases of preventive detention Where such detention could not continue beyond three months without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board, whereas clause (7) (a) made provision for special cases of detention for more than three months with- out the safeguard of the advisory board's opinion, for aggravated forms of prejudicial Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 80 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 conduct. In other words, clause (4) (a) laid down the rule and clause (7) (a) enacted an exception. It was therefore necessary for Parliarnent to indicate to the detaining authority for its guidance the more aggravated forms of prejudicial activity, and mere mention of the subjects in respect of which Parliament is authorised under the legislative lists to make laws in respect of preventive detention could hardly afford any guidance to such authority and should not be regarded as sufficient compliance with the requirements of clause (7). There is a two-fold fallacy in this argument. In the first place, the suggested correla- tion between clause (4) (a) and clause (7) (a) as enacting a rule and an exception is, as a matter of construction, without foundation. Reading clauses (4) and (7) together it is reasonably clear that preventive detention could last longer in two cases: (1) where the opinion of an advisory board is obtained, subject however to a prescribed period [sub-clause (a)of clause (4)] and (2) where a person is detained under a law made by Parliament under sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (7) [sub-clause (b) of clause (4)]. These are two distinct and independent provisions. It is significant that sub-clause (b) of clause (4) is not worded as a proviso or an exception to sub-clause (a) of the same clause as it would have been if it was intended to operate as such. The attempt to correlate clause (4)(a)and clause (7) (a) as a rule and an exception respectively is opposed both to the language and the structure of those clauses. 'Secondly, the argument loses sight of the fact that clause (7) deals with preventive detention which is a purely precautionary measure which ""must necessarily proceed in all cases, to some extent, on suspicion or anticipation as distinct from proof"" [ per Lord Atkinson in Rex v. Halliday (1) ]. The remarks I have' already made with reference to the absence of any objective rules of conduct in section 3 of the impugned Act apply also to this criticism of section 12. It would be difficult, if not impracticable, to mention the variouscircumstances, or to enumerate the various class- es of cases exhaustively in which a person should be de- tained for more than three months for preventive purposes, except in broad outline. Suppose a person belongs to. an organization pledged to violent and subversive activity as its policy. Beyond his membership of theparty the person might have done nothing until he1 was arrested and detained. But if released he might indulge in anything from the mild- est form of prejudicial activity, like sticking an objec- tionable handbill on a hoarding, to the most outrageous acts of sabotage. (1) L.R. 1917 A.C. 260, 275. How could the insertion in section 12 of a long series of categories of aggravated forms of prejudicial activities, or the enumeration of the various circumstances in which such activities are likely to be indulged in, be of any assist- ance to the detaining authority in determining whether the person concerned should be detained for three months or for a longer period ? All that would be necessary and suffi- cient for him to know for coming to a decision on the point is that the person is a member of such an organisation and will probably engage in subversive activities prejudicial to the security of the State or the maintenance of public order or, in other words, he belongs to class (b) in section 12. While enumeration and classification in detail would un- doubtedly help in grading punishment for offences committed, they would not be of much use in fixing the duration of preventive detention. Sufficient guidance in such cases could be given by broadly indicating the general nature Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 81 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 of the prejudicial activity which a person is likely to indulge in, and that in effect is what Parliament has done in sec- tion 12. Reference was made in this connection to Rule 34 of the Defence of India Rules framed under the Defence of India Act, 1939, where ""prejudicial act"" is defined by enumeration. But it was also for the purpose of prohibiting such acts [ Rule 38 sub-rule (1) ] and making them offences (sub-rule 5). And even there, the definition had to end in a residuary clause sweeping in acts likely ""to prejudice the efficient prosecution of the war, the defence of British India or, the public safety or interest."" In Lists I and III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution six topics are mentioned in respect of which Parliament could make laws providing for preventive detention, and section 12 of the impugned Act mentions five of them as being the classes of cases or the circumstances in which longer detention is authorised. I fail to see why this could not be regarded as a broad classification of cases or a broad description of circumstances where Parliament considers longer detention to be justifiable. A class can well be designated with refer- ence to the end which one desires to secure, and the matters referred to as classes (a) and (b) of sub-section (1) of section 12 being clearly the objects which Parliament desired to secure by enacting the section, it seems to me that the classification with refer- ence to such general aims does not contravene article 22 (7). It was argued that Parliament did not, in enacting section 12, perform its duty of prescribing both the circumstances and the class or classes of cases where detention without obtaining the advisory board's opinion could be for a period longer than three months. The use of the disjunctive ""or"" between the word ""circumstances"" and the words ""class or classes of cases"" showed, it was said, that Parliament proceeded on the view that it need not prescribe both. This was in contravention of article 22 (7) which used the con- junctive ""and"" between those words. There is no substance- in this objection. As I read article 22 (7) it means that Parliament may prescribe either the circumstances or the classes of cases or both, and in enacting section 12 Parliament evidently regarded the matters mentioned in clause (a) and (b) of sub-section (1) as sufficiently indic- ative both of the Circumstances under which and the classes in which a person could be detained for the longer period. To say, for instance, that persons who are likely to act prejudicially to the defence of India may be detained beyond three months is at once to ""prescribe a class of persons in which and the circumstances under which"" a person may be detained for the longer period. In other words, the classi- fication itself may be such as to amount to a sufficient description of the circumstances for purposes of clause (7). The circumstances which would justify precautionary deten- tion beyond three months without recourse to an advisory board must be far too numerous for anything approaching an exhaustive enumeration, and it can, in my judgment, be no objection to the validity of section 12 that no circum- stances are mentioned apart from the matters referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (1). It would indeed be singular for the Court to strike down a parliamentary enact- ment because in its opinion a certain classification therein made is imperfect or the mention of certain circumstances is unspecific or inade- quate. Lastly, Mr. Nambiar turned his attack on section 14 which prohibits the disclosure of the grounds of detention communicated to the person detained and of the representa- tion made by him against the order of detention, and debars the Court from allowing such disclosure to be made except for purposes of a prosecution punishable under sub-section (2) which makes it an offence for any person to disclose or publish such grounds or representation without the previous authorisation of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 82 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 the Central Government or the State Government as the case may be. The petitioner com- plains that this provision nullifies in effect the rights conferred upon him under clause (5) of article 22 which entitles him to have the grounds of his detention communi- cated to him and to make a representation against the order. If the grounds are too vague to enable him to make any such representation, or if they are altogether irrelevant to the object of his detention, or are such as to show that his detention is not bona fide, he has the further right of moving this Court and this remedy is also guaranteed to him under article 32. These rights and remedies, the petitioner submits, cannot be effectively excercised, if he is prevent- ed on pain of prosecution, from disclosing the grounds to the Court. There is great force in this contention. All that the Attorney-General could say in answer was that if the other provisions of the Act were held to be valid, it would not be open to the Court to examine the sufficiency of the grounds on which the executive authority was ""satisfied"" that detention was necessary, as laid down in Machindar Shivaji Mahar v. The King (1), and so the petitioner could not complain of any infringement of his rights by reason of section 14 which enacted only a rule of evidence. The argument overlooks that it was recognised in the decision referred to above that it would be open to the Court to examine the grounds of detention in order to see whether they were relevant to the object which the legislature had (1) [1949] F.C.R. 827. in view, such as, for instance, the prevention of acts prejudicial to public safety and tranquillity, or were such as to show that the detention was not bona fide. An examina- tion of the grounds for these purposes is made impossible by section 14, and the protection afforded by article 22 (5) and article 32 is thereby rendered nugatory. It follows that section 14 contravenes the provisions of article 22 (5) and article 32 in so far as it prohibits the person detained from disclosing to the Court the grounds of his detention communicated to him by the detaining authority or the repre- sentation made by him against the order of detention, and prevents the Court from examining them for the purposes aforesaid, and to that extent it must be held under article 13 (2) to be void. This however, does not affect the rest of the Act which is severable. As the petitioner did not disclose the grounds of his detention pending our decision on this point he will now be free to seek his remedy, if so advised, on the basis of those grounds. In the result, the application fails and is dismissed. MAHAJAN J.--The people of India having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a Sovereign Democratic Republic on the 26th day of November 1949 gave to themselves a Constitution which came into force on the 26th January 1950. This is the first case in which this Court has been called upon to determine how far the Constitution has secured personal liberty to the citizens of this country. A.K. Gopalan, the petitioner, who was already under the custody of the Superintendent, Central Jail, Cuddalore, was served with an order of detention under section 3 (1) of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 (Act IV of 1950) on the 27th February 1950. It was said in the order that the Governor of Madras was satisfied that it was necessary to make the order with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State and the maintenance of public order. On 20th March 1950 a petition was presented to this Court under article 32 of the Constitution praying for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus directing the State of Madras to produce him before the Court and to set him at liberty. A writ was accordingly issued. The return to the writ is that the detention is legal under Act IV of 1950, enacted by Parlia- ment. The petitioner contends that the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 83 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 Act abridges and infringes certain provisions of Part III of the Constitution and is thus outside the constitutional limits of the legis- lature and therefore void and unenforceable. The matter is one of great importance both be-cause the legislative power expressly conferred by the 7th Schedule has been impugned and because the liberty of the citizen is seriously affected. The decision of the question whether Act IV of 1950 takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution depends on a consideration of two points: (1) In what measure has the Constitution secured person- al liberty to a citizen of India, and. (2) has the impugned legislation in any way taken away or abridged the rights so secured and if so, to what extent ? Act IV of 1950 provides for preventive detention in certain cases and it has been enacted as a temporary meas- ure. It will cease to have effect on 1st April 1951. It empowers the Central Government and the State Governments to make an order directing a person to be detained with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence of India, the relations of India with foreign powers or the security of India. It also gives power to detain a person who acts in any manner prejudicial to the security of the State or the maintenance of public order or the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community. It came into force on 26th February 1950 and was enacted by virtue of the powers conferred on Parliament by article 22 clause (7) of Part III of the Constitution read with the entries in the 7th Schedule. There can be no doubt that the legislative will expressed herein would be enforceable unless the legislature has failed to keep within its constitutional limits. It is quite obvious that the Court cannot declare a statute unconstitutional and void simply on the ground of unjust and oppressive provi- sions or because it is supposed to violate natural, social or political rights of citizens unless it it can be shown that such injustice is prohibited or such rights are guaranteed or protected by the Constitution. It may also be observed that an Act cannot be declared void because in the opinion of the Court it is opposed to the spirit supposed to pervade the Constitution but not so expressed in words. It is difficult on any general principles to limit the omnipo- tence of the sovereign legislative power by judicial inter- position except in so far as the express words of a written Constitution give that authority. Article 13 (2) of our Constitution gives such an authority and to the extent stated therein. It says that the State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void. Preventive detention laws are repugnant to democratic constitutions and they cannot be found to exist in any of the democratic countries of the world. It was stated at the Bar that no such law was in force in the United States of America. In England for the first time during the first world war certain regulations framed under the Defence of the Realm Act provided for preventive detention at the satisfaction of the Home Secretary as a war measure and they ceased to have effect at the conclusion of hostilities. The same thing happened during thesecond world war. Similar regulations were introduced during the period of the war in India under the Defence of India Act. The Government of India Act, 1935, conferred authority on the Central and Provincial Legislatures to enact laws on this subject for the first time and since then laws on this subject have taken firm root here and have become a permanent part of the statute book of this country. Curiously enough, this subject has found place in Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 84 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 the Constitution in the. chapter on Fundamental Rights. Entry 9 of the Union List and Entry 3 of the Concurrent List of the 7th Schedule mention the scope of legislative power of Parliament in respect of this topic. The jurisdiction, however, to enact these laws is subject to the provisions of Part III of the Constitu- tion. Article 22 in this Part provides :-- ""(1 ) No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice. (2) Every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty-four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate. (3) Nothing in clauses (1) and (2) shall apply (a) to any person who for the time being is an enemy alien; or (b) to any person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention. (4) No law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless- (a) an Advisory Board consisting of persons who are, or have been, or are qualified to be appointed as, Judges of a High Court has reported before the expiration of the said period of three months that there is in its opinion suffi- cient cause for such detention: Provided that nothing in this sub-clause shall authorise the detention of any person beyond the maximum period pre- scribed by any law made by Parliament under sub-clause (b) of clause (7); or (b) such person is detained in accordance with the provisions of any law made by Parliament under sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (7). (5) When any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for preventive detention, the authority making the order shall, as soon as may be, commu- Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 85 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 nicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order. (6) Nothing in clause (5) shall require the authority making any such order as is referred to in that clause to, disclose facts which such authority considers to be against the public interest to disclose, (7) parliament may by law prescribe (a) the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preven- tive detention without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause (a) of clause (4); (b) the maximum period for which any person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law provid- ing for preventive detention; and (c) the procedure to be followed by an Advisory Board in an inquiry under sub-clause (a) of clause (4)."" The question of the constitutional validity of the impugned statute has to be approached with great caution in view of these provisions of the Constitution and has to be considered with patient attention. The benefit of reasona- ble doubt has to be resolved in favour of legislative ac- tion, though such a presumption is not conclusive- It seems that the subject of preventive detention became the particu- lar concern of the Constitution because of its intimate connection with deprivation of personal liberty to protect which certain provisions were introduced in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights and because of the conditions prevailing in the newly born Republic. Preventive detention means a complete negation of freedom of movement and of personal liberty and is incompatible with both those subjects and yet it is placed in the same compartment with them in Part III of the Constitution. Though the Constitution has recognized the necessity of laws as to preventive detention it has also provided certain safeguards to mitigate their harshness by placing fetters on legislative power conferred on this subject. These are- (1) That no law can provide for detention for a period of more than three months unless the sufficiency for the cause of the detention is investigated by an advisory board within the said period of three months. This provision limits legislative power in the matter of duration of the period of detention. A law of preventive detention would be void if it permits detention for a longer period than three months without the intervention of an advisory board. (2) That a State law cannot authorize detention beyond the maximum period prescribed by Parliament under the powers given to it in clause (7). This is a limitation on the legislative power of the State legislature. They cannot make a law authorizing preventive detention for a longer period than that fixed by Parliament. (3) That Parliament also cannot make a law authorizing detention for a period beyond three months without the intervention of an advisory board unless the law conforms to the conditions laid down in clause (7) of article 22. Provision also has been made to enable Parliament to make laws for procedure to be followed by advisory boards. This is a safeguard against any arbitrary form of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 86 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 procedure that may otherwise find place in State laws. Apart from these enabling and disabling provisions certain procedural rights have been expressly safeguarded by clause (5) of article 22. A person detained under a law of preventive detention has a right to obtain information as to the grounds of his detention and has also the right to make a representation protesting against an order of preventive detention. This right has been guaranteed independently of the duration of the period of detention and irrespective of the existence or non-existence of an advisory board. No machinery, however, has been provided or expressly mentioned for dealing with this representation. It seems to me that when a constitutional right has been conferred as a necessary consequence, a constitutional remedy for obtaining redress in case of infringement of the right must be pre- sumed to have been contemplated and it could not have been intended that the right was merely illusory and that a representation made may well find place in cold storage. Consideration of the representation made by virtue of clause (5) by an unbiassed authority is, m my opinion, a necessary consequence of the guaranteed right contained herein. The right has been conferred to enable a detained person to establish his innocence and to secure justice, and no jus- tice can be said to be secured unless the representation is considered by some impartial person. The interpretation that I am inclined to place on clause (5) of article 22 is justi- fied by the solemn words of the declaration contained in the Preamble to the Constitution. It is this declaration that makes our Constitution sublime and it is the guarantees mentioned in the chapter on Fundamental Rights that make it one of the greatest charters of liberty and of which the people, of this country 'may well be proud. This charter has not been forced out of unwilling hands of a sovereign like the Magna Carta but it has been given to themselves by the people of the country through their Constituent Assem- bly. Any interpretation of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution without reference to this solemn declara- tion is apt to lead one into error. If the right of repre- sentation given to a detained person by clause (5) of arti- cle 22 is a guaranteed right and has been given for the purpose of securing justice, then it follows that no justice can be held secured to him unless an unbiassed person considers the merits of the representation and gives his opinion on the guilt or the innocence of the persons detained. In my view, the right cannot be defeated or made elusive by presuming that the detaining authority itself will consider the representation with an unbiassed mind and will render justice. That would in a way make the prosecu- tor a judge in the case and such a procedure is repugnant. to all notions of justice. The Constitution has further curtailed the rights given in clause (5) by providing in clause (6) a privilege on the detaining authority of witholding facts which the said authority considers not in public interests to disclose. This privilege has been conferred for the security of the State and possibly for the security of the Constitution itself, but in view of these stringent provi- sions no additional clogs can be put on the proper consider- ation of the representation of the detained person by pre- suming that the detaining authority itself will properly consider the representation. It has also to be remembered in this context that a person-subjected to the law of pre- ventive detention has been deprived of the rights conferred on persons who become subject to the law of punitive deten- tion [vide clauses (1) and (2) of article 22]. He has been denied the right to consult a lawyer or be defended by him and he can be kept in detention without being produced before a magistrate. Having examined the provisions of article 22, I now proceed to consider the first question that was canvassed before us by the learned Attorney-General, i.e., that arti- cle 22 of the Constitution read Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 87 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 with the entries in the 7th Schedule was a complete Code on the subject of preventive detention, and that being so, the other articles of Part III could not be invoked in the consideration of the validity of the impugne'd statute. It was conceded by the learned coun- sel for the petitioner that to the extent that express provisions exist in article 22 on the topic of preventive detention those provisions would prevail and could not be controlled by the other provisions of Part III. It was, however, urged that on matters on which this article had made no special provision on this topic the other provisions of Part III of the Constitution had application, namely, articles 10 and 21 and to that extent laws made on this subject were justiciable. In order to draw the inference that the framers of the Constitution intended the provisions as regards preventive detention in article 22 to be self- contained a clear indication of such an intention has to be gathered. If the provisions embodied in this article have dealt with all the principal questions that are likely to arise in matters of procedure or on questions of the reasonableness of the period of detention, the inference of such an indica- tion would be irresistible. Ordinarily when a subject is expressly dealt with in a constitution in some detail, it has to be assumed that the intention was to exclude the application of the general provisions contained therein elsewhere. Express mention of one thing is an exclusion of the other. Expressio unius est exclusio alterius. I am satisfied on a review of the whole scheme of the Constitu- tion that the intention was to make article 22 self-con- tained in respect of the laws on the subject of preventive detention. It was contended that all the articles in the Constitution should be read in an harmonious manner and one article should not be read as standing by itself and as having no connection with the other articles in the same part. It was said that they were all supplementary to one another. In this connection it was argued that a law made under article 22 would not be valid unless it was in accord with the provisions of article 21 of the Constitution. This article provides that no person shall be deprived of life or liberty' except according to procedure established by law. It was contended that in substance the article laid down that no person will be deprived of life or liberty without having been given a fair trial or a fair hearing and that unless a law of preventive detention provided such a hearing that law would be in contravention of this article and thus void. Conceding for the sake of argument (but without expressing any opinion on it ) that this contention of the learned counsel is correct, the question arises whether there is anything in article 22 which negatives the application of article 21 as above construed to a law on preventive detention. In my opinion, sub-clause (5) of article 22 read with clauses (1) and (2) leads to the inference that the contention raised by the learned counsel is unsound. Clause (5), as already stated, provides that notice has to be given to a detenu of the grounds of his detention. It also provides a limited hearing inasmuch as it gives him an opportunity to establish his innocence. As, in my opinion, the considera- tion of a representation made by a detained person by an unbiassed authority is implicit in clause (5) it gives to the detained person all that he is entitled to under the principles of natural justice. The right to consult and to be represented by a counsel of his own choice has been denied in express terms to such a person by the Constitu- tion. He is also denied an opportunity of appearing before a magistrate. When the Constitution has taken away certain rights that ordinarily will be possessed by a detained person and in substitution thereof certain other rights have been conferred on him even in the matter of procedure, the inference is clear that the intention was to deprive such a person of the right of an elaborate procedure usually pro- vided for in judicial proceedings. Clause (6) of article 22 very strongly supports this conclusion. There would have been no point in laying down such detailed rules of proce- dure in respect of a law of preventive detention if the intention was that such a law would be subject to the provi- sions of article 21 of the Constitution. In its Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 88 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 ultimate analysis the argument of the learned counsel for the peti- tioner resolves itself to this: that the impugned statute does not provide for an impartial tribunal for a considera- tion of the representation of the detained person and to this extent it contravenes article 21 of the Constitution. As discussed above, in ray opinion, such a provision is implicit within article 22 itself and that being so, the application of article 21 to a law made under article 22 is excluded. It was next contended that a law of preventive detention encroaches on the right of freedom of movement within the territory of India guaranteed to a citizen under article 19 (1) (d) and that being so, by reason of the provisions of sub-clause (5) of article 19 it was justiciable on the ground of reasonableness. It is true, as already pointed out, that a law of preventive detention is wholly incompati- ble with the right of freedom of movement of a citizen. Preventive detention in substance is a negation of the freedom of locomotion guaranteed under article 19 (1) (d) but it cannot be said that it merely restricts it. Be that as it may, the question for consideration is whether it was intended that article 19 would govern a law made under the provisions of article 22. Article 19 (5) is a saving and an enabling provision. It empowers Parliament to make a law imposing reasonable restriction on the right of freedom of movement while article 22 (7) is auother enabling provision empower- ing Parliament to make a law on the subject of preventive detention in certain circumstances. If a law conforms to the conditions laid down in 'article 22 (7), it would be a good law and it could not have been intended that that law validly made should also conform itself to the provisions of article 19 (5). One enabling provision cannot be considered as a safeguard against another enabling provision. Article 13 (2) has absolutely no application in such a situation. If the intention of the constitution was that a law made on the subject of preventive detention had to be tested on the touchstone of reasonableness, then it would not have trou- bled itself by expressly making provision in article 22 about the precise scope of the limitation subject to which such a law could be made and by mentioning the procedure that the law dealing with that subject had to provide. Some of the provisions of article 22 would then have been redun- dant, for instance, the provision that no detention can last longer than three months without the necessity of such detention being examined by an advisory board. This provi- sion negatives the idea that the deprivation of liberty for a period of three months without the consultation of the advisory board would be justiciable on the ground of reason- ableness. Again article 22 has provided a safeguard that if an advisory board has to be dispensed with, it can only be so dispensed with under a law made by Parliament and that Parliament also in enacting such a law has to conform to certain conditions. This provision would have' been unnec- essary in article 22 if a law on this subject was justicia- ble. In sub-clause (b) of clause (7) of article 22 provision has been made enabling Parliament to fix the maximum period for which a person can be detained under a law on the sub- ject of preventive detention. Under this express provision it is open to Parliament to fix any period, say, even a period of five to ten years as the maximum period of detention of a person. Can it be said that in view of this express provision of the Constitution such a law was intended to be justiciable by reason of article 19 (5) ? Duration of detention is the principal matter in preventive detention laws which possibly could be examined on the touchstone of reasonableness under article 19 (5), but this has been expressly excluded by express provisions in article 22. In my judgment, therefore, an examination of the provisions of article 22 clearly suggests that the intention was to make it self-contained as regards the law of preventive detention and that the validity of a law on the subject Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 89 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 of preventive detention cannot be exam- ined or controlled either by the provisions of article 21 or by the provisions of article 19 (5) because article 13 (2) has no application to such a situation and article 22 is not subject to the provisions of these two articles. The Consti- tution in article 22 has gone to the extent of even provid- ing that Parliament may by law lay down the procedure to be followed by an advisory board. On all important points that could arise in connection with the subject of preventive detention provision has been made in article 22 and that being so, the only correct approach in examining the validi- ty of a law on the subject of preventive detention is by considering whether the law made satisfied the requirements of article 22 or in any way abridges or contravenes them and if the answer is in the affirmative, then the law will be valid, but if the answer is in the negative, the law would be void. In expressing the view that article 22 is in a sense self-contained on the law of preventive detention I should not however be understood as laying down that the framers of the article in any way overlooked the safeguards laid down in article 21. Article 21, in my opinion. lays down sub- stantive law as giving protection to life and liberty inas- much as it says that they cannot be deprived except accord- ing to the procedure established by law; in other words, it means that before a person can be deprived of his life or liberty as a condition precedent there should exist some substantive law conferring authority for doing so and the law should further provide for a mode of procedure for such depriva- tion. This article gives complete' immunity against the exercise of despotic power by the executive. It further gives immunity against invalid laws which contravene the Constitution. It gives also further guarantee that in its true concept there should be some form of proceeding before a person can be condemned either in respect of his life or his liberty. It negatives the idea of fantastic, arbitrary and oppressive forms of proceedings. The principles there- fore underlying article 21 have been kept in view in draft- ing article 22. A law properly made under article 22 and which is valid in all respects under that article and lays down substantive as well as adjective law on this subject would fully satisfy the requirements of article 21, and that being so, there is no conflict between these two articles. The next question that arises for decision is whether there is anything in Act IV of 1950 which offends against the provisions of article 22 of Part III of the Constitu- tion. The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that section 3 of the Act was bad inasmuch as it made ""satisfaction of the Government"" as the criterion for de- taining a person. It was said that as section 3 laid down no objective rule of conduct for a person and as people were not told as to what behaviour was expected of them, the result was that it could not be known what acts a person was expected to avoid and what conduct on his part was prejudi- cial to the security of the State or the maintenance of' public order; in other words, it was argued that section 3 left the determination of the prejudicial act of a person to the arbitrary judgment of the Government and that even the officer who was to administer this law had been furnished no guide and no standard of conduct in arriving at his own satisfaction whether the conduct was prejudicial to the security of the State etc. This criticism of the learned counsel, in my opinion, is not valid, It is no doubt true that a detention order depends on the satisfac- tion of the' Government but this provision is in accordance with article 22 of the Constitution which to my mind contemplates detention on the satisfaction of the executive authority. By its very nature the subject is such that it implies detention on the judgment of the authority entrusted with the making of the order. The whole intent and purpose of the law of preventive detention would be defeated if satis- faction of the authority concerned was subject to such an objective standard and was also subject to conditions as to legal proof and procedure. In the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 90 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 7th Schedule jurisdiction to make the law on this subject has been given for reasons connected with defence etc. and the maintenance of public order. These are subjects which concern the life and the very existence of the State. Every citizen is presumed to know what behaviour is prejudicial to the life of the State or to its existence as an ordered State. Considering that the State is presumed to have a government that conducts itself in a reasonable way and also presuming that its officers usually will be reasonable men, it cannot be said that in making ""satisfaction of the government"" as the standard for judging prejudicial acts of persons who are subject to the law of preventive detention section 3 in any way contravenes article 22 of the constitution. Section 7 of the impugned Act gives full effect to the provisions of article 22 sub clause (5) and enacts that representation has to be made to the Central or State Gov- ernment as the case may be. It was impeached on the ground that no machinery has been provided herein to consider and adjudicate on the merits of the representation. To this extent, as already indicated, the law is defective. In the absence of a machinery for the investigation of the conten- tions raised in the representation it may be open to the detenu to move this Court under article 32 for a proper relief. It is, however, unnecessary to express any opin- ion as to the precise remedy open to a detained person in this respect. The absence of a provision of this nature in the statute however would not make the law wholly void. Section 9 of the Act makes reference to the advisory board obligatory in cases falling under sub-clause (iii) of clause (a) or clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section a within six weeks of the order. The proce- dure to be followed by the advisory board is laid down in section 10. Parliament has been authorized to lay down such a procedure to be followed by an advisory board in sub- clause (c) of clause (7). It was contended that the law had not provided a personal hearing to the detenu before an advisory board, nor had it given him a right to lead evi- dence to establish his innocence. In my opinion, this criticism is not sound and does not in any way invalidate the law. The advisory board has been given the power to call for such information as it requires even from the person detained. It has also been empowered to examine the materi- al placed before it in the light of the facts and arguments contained in the representation. The opportunity afforded is not as full as a person gets under normal judicial proce- dure but when the Constitution itself contemplates a special procedure being prescribed for preventive detention cases, then the validity of the law on that subject cannot be impugned on the grounds contended for. Section 11 of the Act was also impugned on the ground that it offended against the Constitution inasmuch as it provided for preventive detention for an indefinite period. This section in my opinion has to be read in the background of the provision in sub-clause (3) of section 1 of the Act which says that the Act will cease to have effect on 1st April, 1951. Besides, the words ""for such period as it thinks fit"" do not in any way offend against the provisions of article 22 wherein Parliament has been given the power to make a law fixing the maximum period for preventive deten- tion. It has to be noted that Parliament has fixed a period of one year as the maximum period for the duration of detention where detention has to be without reference to an advisory board. In my opinion, there is nothing in section 11 which is outside the constitutional limits of the powers of the supreme legislature. It is section 12 of the Act which was assailed by the learned counsel for the petitioner rather vehemently. This section is of a very controversial character. It has been enacted on the authority of clause (7) of article 22 and runs thus :-- Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 91 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 ""(1) Any person detained in any of the following classes of cases or under any of the following circumstances may be detained without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board for a period longer than three months, but not exceed- ing one year from the date of his detention, namely, where such person has been detained with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to- (a) the defence of India, relations of India with for- eign powers or the security of India; or (b) the security of a State or the maintenance of public order. (2) The case of every person detained under a detention order to which the provisions of sub-section (1) apply shall, within a period of six months from the date of his detention, be reviewed where the order was made by the Central Government or a State Government, by such Govern- ment, and where the order was made by any officer specified in sub-section (2) of section a, by the State Government to which such officer is subordinate, in consultation with a person who is, or has been, or is qualified to be appointed as, a Judge of a High Court nominated in that behalf by the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be."" The section purports to comply with the conditions laid down in clause (7) of article 22. It was, however, argued that in substance and reality it has failed to comply with any of the conditions laid down therein; that it neither mentions the circumstances under which nor the classes of cases in which preventive detention without recourse to the machinery of an advisory board could be permitted. The crucial question for consideration is whether section 12 mentions any circumstances under which or defined the class- es of cases in which authority was conferred by clause (7) to dispense with an advisory board. So far as I have been able to gather from opinions of text-book writers on the subject of classification, the rule seems clear that in making classification of cases there has to be some rela- tionship to the classification to the objects sought to be accomplished. The question for consideration therefore is what object was sought to be accomplished when the Constitu- tion included clause (7) in article 22. It seems clear that the real purpose of clause (7) was to provide for a contin- gency where compulsory requirement of an advisory board may defeat the object of the law of preventive detention. In my opinion, it was incorporated in the Constitution to meet abnormal and exceptional cases, the cases being of a kind where an advisory board could not be taken into confidence. The authority to make such drastic legislation was entrusted to 'the supreme legislature but with the further safeguard that it can only enact a law of such a drastic nature provided it prescribed the circumstances under which such power had to be used or in the alternative it prescribed the classes of cases or stated a determinable group of cases in which this could be done. The intention was to lay down some objective standard for the guidance of the detaining authority on the basis of which without consultation of an advisory board detention could be ordered beyond the period of three months. In this connection it has to be remembered that the Constitution must have thought of really some abnormal situation and of some dangerous groups of persons when it found it necessary to dispense with a tribu- nal like an advisory board which functions in camera and which is not bound even to give a personal hearing to the detenu and whose proceedings are privileged. The law on the subject of preventive detention in order to avoid even Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 92 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 such an innocuous institution could only be justified on the basis of peculiar circumstances and peculiar situations which had to be objectively laid down and that was what in my opinion was intended by clause (7). If the peculiarity lies in a situation outside 'the control or view of a de- tained person, then it may be said that the description of such a situation would amount to a prescription of the circumstances justifying the detention for a longer period than three months by a law without the intervention of an advisory board'. If, however, the abnormality relates to the conduct and character of the activities of a certain determinable group of persons, then that would amount to a class of cases which was contemplated to be dealt with under clause (7). In such cases alone arbitrary detention could be held justifiable by law beyond a period of three months. It was argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that the phrase ""circumstances under which, and the classes of cases in which"" used in clause (7) had to be construed in a cumulative sense; on the other hand, the learned Attorney-General contended that the word ""and"" had been used in this clause in the same sense as ""or."" He further argued that even if the word ""and"" is not given that meaning the true construction of the phrase was that Parliament could prescribe either the circumstances or the classes of cases for making a law on the subject of preventive detention authorizing detention for a longer period than three months without the machinery of an advisory board. In Full Bench Reference No. 1 of 1950, Das Gupta J. of the Calcutta High Court held that the intention of the legislature in enacting the clause was that the law of preventive detention author- izing detention for a longer period than three months with- out the intervention of an advisory board had to fulfil both the requirements laid down in clause (7) and not only one of the requirements in the alternative. The same view has been expressed by my brother Sir Fazl Ali. I share this view with him. I would, however, like to consider this matter from a different aspect on the assumption that the contention raised by the learned Attorney-General is right. Dealing first with the question whether section 12 mentions any circumstances, so far as I have been able to see, it does not prescribe any circumstances unless it can be said that the prejudicial acts for reasons connected with the security of State, maintenance of public order, etc. are both the circumstances as well as the classes of cases. In my opinion, this line of approach cannot be held to be correct in the construction of clause (7) of article 22. I am inclined to agree with the learned Attorney-General that the phrase ""circumstances under which"" means some situation extraneous to the detenu's own acts, in other words, it means some happening in the country with which the detenu is not concerned, such as a situation of tense communal feelings, an apprehended internal rebellion or disorder, the crisis of an impending war or apprehended war, etc. In such a situation the machinery of an advisory board could be dispensed with because it may become cumber- some or it may hamper the exercise of necessary powers. In this view of the matter I have no hesitation in holding that no circumstances have been stated in section 12, though the section ostensibly says so. If it was permissible to con- jecture, it seems that the draftsman of section 12' repeated the words of clause' (7) of article 22 without an applica- tion of his mind to the meaning of those words and as the legislation was passed in haste to meet an emergent situa- tion, it suffers from the defects which all hasty legisla- tion suffer from. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 93 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 I now proceed to consider whether section 12 has classi- fied the cases in which detention for a longer period beyond three months could be suffered by a citizen without the benefit of the machinery of an advisory board. The section has placed five subjects out of the legislative list within its ambit and these are described as the classes of cases. The question is whether it can be said that a mere selection of all or any of the categories of the subjects for reasons connected with which a law of preventive detention could be' made under the 7th Schedule amounts to a classification of cases as contemplated in clause (7) of article 22. Entry 9 of the Union List and Entry 3 of the Concurrent List of the 7th Schedule lay down the ambit of legislative power of Parliament on the subject of preventive detention on the following six subjects :-- (1) Defence of India, (2) Foreign Affairs, (a) Security of India, (4) Security of the State, (5) Mainten- ance of public order, (6) Maintenance of supplies and serv- ices essential to the community. Clause (4) of article 22 enjoins in respect of all the six subjects that no law can provide for preventive deten- tion for a longer period than three months without reference to an advisory board. Clause (7) gives permission to make a law for dispensing with an advisory board by a prescription of the circumstances and by a prescription of the classes of cases in which such a dispensation can be made. The legis- lative authority under clauses (4) and (7)in my opinion, extends to all these six subjects. The normal procedure to be followed when detention is intended to be beyond a period of three months in respect of the six subjects is provided in sub-clause (4) The extraordinary and unusual procedure was intended, to be adopted in certain abnormal cases for which provision could be made by a parliamentary statute under clause (7). It seems to me, however, that section- 12 of Act IV of 1950 has reversed this process quite contrary to the intention of the Constitution. By this section Act IV of 1950 has dispensed with the advisory board in five out of the six subjects above mentioned and the compulsory procedure of an advisory board laid down in clause (4) of article 22 has been relegated to one out of these six sub- jects. This has been achieved by giving a construction to the phrase ""circumstances under which and the classes of cases in which"" so as to make it co-extensive and cotermi- nous with the ""subjects of legislation."" In my opinion, this construction of clause (7) is in contravention of the clear provisions of article 22, and makes clause (4) of article -9,2 to all intents and purposes nugatory. Such a construction of the clause would amount to the Constitution saying in one breath that a law of preventive detention cannot provide for detention for a longer period than three months without reference to an advisory board and at the same breath and moment saying that Parliament, if it so chooses, can do so in respect of all or any of the subjects mentioned in the legislative field. If that was so, it would have been wholly unnecessary to provide such a safe- guard in the Constitution on a matter which very seriously affects personal liberty. On the other hand, it would be a reasonable construction of the clause to hold that the Constitution authorized Parliament that in serious classes of cases or in cases of those groups of persons who are incorrigible or whose activities are secret the procedure of an advisory board may well be dispensed with, that being necessary in the interests of the State. On the other construction as adopted by the framers of section 12, the Constitution need not have troubled itself by con- ferring an authority on Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 94 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 Parliament for making such a law. Moreover, if that was the intention, it would have in very clear words indicated this by drafting article 22 clause (4) thus: ""Unless otherwise provided by Parliament no law provid- ing for preventive detention shall authorize detention for a longer period than three months unless an Advisory Board has investigated the sufficiency of the cause of such detention."" The words ""Unless otherwise provided for by Parliament"" would have been in accord with the construction which the framers of section 12 have placed on article 22 clause (7). I am further of the opinion that the construction placed by the learned Attorney-General on clause (7) of article 22 and adopted by the framers of Act IV of 1950 creates a very anomalous situation. The matter may be examined from the point of view of the law of preventive detention for reasons connected with supplies and services essential to the life of the community. This subject has been put under section 9 in Act IV of 1950. Suppose a tense situation arises and there is a danger of the railway system being sabotaged and it becomes necessary to pass detention orders against cer- tain persons. According to Act IV of 1950 in such a serious state of affairs the procedure of an advisory board is compulsory, while on the other hand, if there is an appre- hension of disturbance of public order by reason of a wrong decision of an umpire at a cricket match or on account of conduct of persons celebrating the festival of Holi, then detention beyond three months can be ordered without reference to an advisory board. Could such an anomalous result be in the contempla- tion of the framers of the Constitution ? The construction that I am inclined to place on the section is in accord with the scheme of the law of punitive detention. Hurt is an offence under the Indian Penal Code and this is one of the subjects of punitive detention. The cases on the subject have been classified in different groups, namely, simple hurt, grievous hurt, grievous hurt with dangerous weapons, grievous hurt to extort a confession, grievous hurt to restrain a public officer from doing his duty, grievous hurt by a rash act, and grievous hurt on provocation. Even simple hurt has been classified in different categories. The sub- ject of assault has also been similarly dealt with. Sections 352 to 356 deal with cases classified according to the gravity of the offence, i.e., cases of simple assault, assault on a public servant, assault on women, assault in attempt to'commit theft, assault for wrongfully confining a person and assault on grave provocation have been separately grouped. Another illustration is furnished by the Criminal Procedure Code in the preventive sections 107 to 110. These deal with different groups of persons; vagrants are in one class, habitual offenders in another, bad characters in the third and disturbers of peace in the fourth. It seems that it is on lines similar to these that it must have been contemplated by the Constitution that classes of cases would be prescribed by Parliament, but this has not been done. The Constitution has recognised varying scales of duration of detention with the idea that this will vary with the nature of the apprehended act, detention for a period of three months in ordinary cases, detention for a longer period than three months with the intervention Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 95 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 of an adviso- ry board in more serious cases, while detention for a longer period than three months without the intercession of an advisory board for a still more dangerous class and for acts committed in grave situations. It can hardly be said that all cases of preventive detention for reasons connected with the maintenance of public order stand on the same footing in the degree of gravity and deserve the same duration of detention and all cases connected with the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community stand in the matter of their gravity on such a footing as to require a lenient treatment. It is true that in a sense all persons who act prejudicially to the defence of India may be comprehensively said to form one group and similarly persons who act prejudicially to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community may form another class but the question is, whether it was in this comprehensive sense that classifica- tion was intended by the Constitution in clause (7) or was it intended in a narrower and restricted sense ? It has to be remembered that the law under clause (7) was intended to provide detention for a longer period and such a law very seriously abridges personal liberty and in this situation giving a narrower and restricted meaning to this expression will be in accordance with well established canons of con- struction of statutes. The wide construction of clause (7) of article 22 brings within the ambit of the clause all the subjects in the legislative list and very seriously abridges the personal liberty of a citizen. This could never have been the inten- tion of the framers of the Constitution. The narrow and restricted interpretation is in accord with the scheme of the article and it also operates on the whole field of the legislative list and within that field it operates by demar- cating certain portions out of each subject which requires severe treatment. If I may say so m conclusion, section 12 treats the lamb and the leopard in the same class because they happen to be quadrupeds. Such a classification could not have been in the thoughts of the Constitution-makers when clause (7) was introduced in article 22. For the reasons given above, I am of the opinion that section 12 of Act IV of 1950 does not fulfil the requirements of clause (7) of article 22 of the Constitution and is not a law which falls within the ambit of that clause. That being so, this section of Act IV of 1950 is void and by reason of it the detention of the petitioner cannot be justified. There is no other provision in this law under which he can be detained for any period whatsoever. It was argued that it was neither practicable nor possi- ble to make a classification on any definite basis in the case of apprehended acts of persons whose activities are of a prejudicial character to the maintenance of public order or to the security of the State or to the defence of India. This contention to my mind is not sound. Such a classifica- tion was made in the rules under the Defence of India Act by defining ""a prejudicial act"" in regulation 34. Mere difficulty in precisely ascertaining the groups or in defin- ing objectively the conduct of such groups is no ground for not complying with the clear provisions of the statute or for disobeying it. I see no difficulty whatsoever if a serious effort was made to comply with the provisions of clause (7). I cannot see that the compulsory requirement of an advisory board is likely to lead to such disastrous or calamitous results that in all Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 96 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 cases or at least in five out of the six subjects of legislation it becomes necessary to dispense with this requirement. The requirement of an advi- sory board is in accordance with the preamble of the Consti- tution and is the barest minimum that can make a law of preventive detention to some little degree tolerable to a democratic Constitution. Such a law also may have some justification even without the requirement of an advisory board to meet certain defined dangerous situations or to deal with a class of people who are a danger to the State but without such limitation the law would be destructive of all notions of personal liberty. The Constitution must be taken to have furnished an adequate safeguard to its citi- zens when it laid down certain conditions in clause (7) and it could not be considered that it provided no safeguard to them at all and that the words used in clause (7) were merely illusory and had no real meaning. Section 14 of Act IV of 1950 has been impugned on the ground that it contravenes and abridges the provisions of articles 22 (5) and 32 of the Constitution. This section is in these terms:-- ""(1) No Court shall except for the purposes of a prose- cution for an offence punishable under subsection (2), allow any statement to be made, or any evidence to be given, before it of the substance of any communication made under section 7 of the grounds on which a detention order has been made against any person or of any representation made by him against such order, and notwithstanding anything con- tained in any other law, no Court shall be entitled to require any public officer to produce before it, or to disclose the substance of, any such communication or repre- sentation made, or the proceedings of an advisory board or that part of the report of an advisory board which is confi- dential. (2) It shall be an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both, for any person to disclose or publish without the previous authorisation of the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, any contents or matter purporting to be contents of any such communication or representation as is referred to in sub-section (1): Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall apply to a disclosure made to his legal adviser by a person who is the subject of a detention order."" This section is in the nature of an iron curtain around the acts of the authority making the order of preventive detention. The Constitution has guaranteed to the detained person the right to be told the grounds of detention. He has been given a right to make a representation [vide arti- cle 22 (5)], yet section 14 prohibits the disclosure of the grounds furnished to him or the contents of the representa- tion made by him in a Court of law and makes a breach of this injunction punishable with imprisonment. Article 32 (1) of the Constitution is in these terms :-- ""The right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed."" Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 97 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 Sub-section (4) says :-- ""The right guaranteed by this article shall not be suspended except as otherwise provided for by this Constitu- tion."" Now it is quite clear that if an authority passes an order of preventive detention for reasons not connected with any of the six subjects mentioned in the 7th Schedule, this Court can always declare the detention illegal and release the detenu, but it is not possible for this Court to func- tion if there is a prohibition against disclosing the grounds which have been served upon him. It is only by an examination of the grounds that it is possible to say wheth- er the grounds fall within the ambit of the legislative power contained in the Constitution or are outside its scope. Again something may be served on the detenu as being grounds which are not grounds at all. In this contingency it is the right of the detained person under article 32 to move this Court for enforcing the right under article 22 (5) that he be given the real grounds on which the detention order is based. This Court would be disabled from exercis- ing its functions under article 32 and adjudicating on the point that the grounds given satisfy the requirements of the sub-clause if it is not open to it to see the grounds that have been furnished. It is a guaranteed right of the person detained to have the very grounds which are the basis of the order of detention. This Court would be entitled to examine the matter and to see whether the grounds furnished are the grounds on the basis of which he has been detained or they contain some other vague or irrelevant material. The whole purpose of furnishing a detained person with the grounds is to enable him to make a representation refuting these grounds and of proving his innocence. In order that this Court may be able to safeguard this fundamental right and to grant him relief it is absolutely essential that the detenu is not prohibited under penalty of punishment to disclose the grounds to the Court and no injunction by law can be issued to this Court disabling it from having a look at the grounds. Section 14 creates a substantive offence if the grounds are disclosed and it also lays a duty on the Court not to permit the disclosure of such grounds. It virtually amounts to a suspension of a guaranteed right provided by the Constitution inasmuch as it indirectly by a stringent provision makes administration of the law by this Court impossible and at the same time it deprives a detained person from obtaining justice from this Court. In my opin- ion, therefore, this section when it prohibits the disclo- sure of the grounds contravenes or abridges the rights given by Part III to a citizen and is ultra vires the powers of Parliament to that extent. The result of the above discussion is that, in my opin- ion, sections 12 and 14 of Act IV of 1950 as above indicated are void and the decision of the detenu's case has to be made by keeping out of sight these two provisions in the Act. If sections 12 and 14 are deleted from the impugned legislation, then the result is that the detention of the petitioner is not legal. The statute has not provided for detention for a period of three months or less in such cases as it could have done under article22 (4) of the Constitu- tion and that being so, the petitioner cannot be justifia- bly detained even for a period of three months. I would accordingly order his release. In view of the decision above arrived at I do not con- sider it necessary to express any opinion on the other points that were argued at great length before us, namely, (1)what is 'the scope and true meaning of the expression ""procedure established by law"" in article 21 of the Consti- tution, and (2) what is the precise scope of articles 19 (1) Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 98 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 (d) and 19 (5)of the Constitution. MUKHERJEA J.--This is an application under article 32 of the Constitution praying for a writ of habeas corpus upon the respondents with a view to release the petitioner who, it is alleged, is being unlawfully detained in the Central Jail, Cuddalore, within the State of Madras. The petitioner, it is said, was initially arrested in Malabar on 17th of December, 1947, and prosecution was started against him on various charges for having delivered certain violent speeches. While these criminal cases were going on, he was served with an order of deten- tion under the Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act on 22nd April, 1948. This order of detention was held to be illegal by the Madras High Court, but on the same day that the judgment was pronounced, a second order of detention was served upon him. On his moving the High Court again for a writ of habeas corpus in respect to the subsequent order, his application was dismissed on the ground that as he was not granted bail in one of the three criminal cases that were pending against him, the detention could not be said to be unlawful. Liberty, however, was given to him to renew his application if and when his detention under the criminal proceedings ceased. In two out of the three criminal cases the trial before the magistrate ended on February 23, 1949, and the petitioner was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 6 months in each of the cases. These sentences, however, were set aside in appeal on 26th September, 1949. As re- gards the third case, he was tried by the Sessions Judge of North Malabar and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for 5 years but this sentence was reduced to 6 months' imprison- ment by the Madras High Court on appeal. The petitioner made a fresh application to the High Court praying for a writ of habeas corpus in respect of his detention under the Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act and this application, which was heard after he had served out his sentences of imprisonment referred to above, was dismissed in January, 1950. On 25th February, 1950, the Preventive Detention Act was passed by the Parliament and on the 1st of March follow- ing, the the detention of the applicant under the Madras Maintainance of Public Order Act was cancelled and he was served with a fresh order of detention under section 3 (1) of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950. On behalf of the respondents the detention of the petitioner is sought to be justified on the strength of the Preventive Detention Act of 1950. The position taken up on behalf of the petitioner on the other hand is that the said Act is invalid and ultra vires the conStitution by reason of its being in conflict with certain fundamental rights which are guaranteed by the Constitution. It is argued, therefore, that the detention of the peti- tioner is invalid and that he should be set at liberty. The contentions that have been but forward-by Mr. Nambi- ar who appeared in support of the petition, may be classi- fied under four heads. His first contention is that as preventive detention is, in substance, a restriction on the free movements of a person throughout the Indian territory, it comes within the purview of article 19 (1) (d) of Part III of the Constitution which lays down the fundamental rights. Under clause (5) of the article, any restriction imposed upon this right of free movement must be reasonable and should be prescribed in the interests of the general public. The question as to whether it is reasonable or not is a justiciable matter which is to be determined by the Court. This being the legal position, the learned Counsel invites us to hold that the main provisions of the impugned Act, particularly those which are contained in sections 3, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 are wholly unreasonable and should be invalidated on that ground. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 99 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 The second contention advanced by the learned Counsel is that the impugned legislation is in conflict with the provi- sion of article 21 of the Constitution inasmuch as it pro- vides for deprivation of the personal liberty of a man not in accordance with a procedure established by law. It is argued that the word 'law' here does not mean or refer to any particular legislative enactment but it means the gener- al law of the land, embodying those principles of natural justice' with regard to procedure which are regarded as fundamental, in all systems of civilised jurisprudence. It is conceded by the learned counsel that the proce- dure, if any, with regard to preventive detention as has been prescribed by article 22 of the Constitution which itself finds a place in the chapter on Fundamental Rights must override those general rules of procedure which are contemplated by article 21 but with regard to matters for which no provision is made in article 22, the general provi- sion made in article 21 must apply. He has indicated in course of his arguments what the essentials of such procedure are and the other point specifically raised in this connection is that the provision of section 12 of the Preventive Detention Act is in conflict with article 22 (7) of the Constitution. The last argument in support of this application is that the provisions of sections 3 and 14 of the Preventive Deten- tion Act are invalid as they take away and render completely nugatory the fundamental right to constitutional remedies as is provided for in article 32 of the Constitution. In discussing these points it should be well to keep in mind the general scheme of the Indian Constitution relating to the protection of the fundamental rights of the citizens and the limitations imposed in this respect upon the legis- lative powers of the Government. The Constitution of India is a written Constitution and though it has adopted many of the principles of the English Parliamentary system, it has not accepted the English doctrine of the absolute supremacy of Parliament in matters of legislation. In this respect it has followed the American Constitution and other systems modelled on it. Notwithstanding the representative charac- ter of their political institutions, the Americans regard the limitations imposed by their Constitution upon the action of the Government, both legislative and executive, as essential to the preservation of public and private rights. They serve as a check upon what has been described as the despotism of the majority; and as was observed in the case of Hurtado v. The People of California (1) ""a government which holds the lives, the liberty and the property of its citizens, subject at all times to the absolute disposition and unlimited control of even the most democratic depository of power, is after all but a despotism."" In India it is the Constitution that is supreme and Parliament as well as the State Legislatures must not only act within the limits of their respective legislative spheres as demarcated in the three (1) 110 U.S. 516. lists occuring in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, but Part III of the Constitution guarantees to the citizens certain fundamental rights which the legislative authority can on no account transgress. A statute law to be valid must, in all cases, be in conformity with the constitutional requirements and it is for the judiciary to decide whether any enactment is unconstitutional or not. Article 13 (2) is imperative on this point and provides expressly that the State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the right conferred by this Part and any law made in contra- vention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contra- vention, be void. Clause (1) of the article similarly invalidates all existing laws which are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part of the Constitution. The fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution have been classified under seven heads or categories. They are: (1) Right to equality; Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 100 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 (2) Right to freedom; (3) Right against exploitation; (4) Right to freedom of religion; (5) Cultural and educational rights; (6) Right to property; and (7) Right to constitutional remedy. The arrangement differs in many respects from that adopted in the American Constitution and bears a likeness on certain points to similar declarations in the Constitutions of other countries. Of the different classes of fundamental rights spoken of above, we are concerned here primarily with right to freedom which is dealt with in four articles beginning from article 19 and also with the right to constitutional remedy which is embodied in article 32. Article 10 enumerates certain forms of liberty or free- dom, the protection of which is guaranteed by the Constitu- tion. In article 20, certain protections are given in cases of persons accused of criminal offences. Article 21 lays down in general terms that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty, except according to procedure established by law. Article 22 pro- vides for certain additional safeguards in respect to arrest and detention and by way of exception to the rules so made, makes certain special provisions for the particular form of detention known as Preventive Detention. The first contention advanced by Mr. Nambiar involves a consideration of the question as to whether Preventive Detention, which is the subject matter of the impugned legislative enactment, comes within the purview of article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution, according to which a right to move freely throughout the territory of India is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to all citizens. If it comes within that sub-clause, it is not disputed that clause (5) of article 19 would be attracted to it and it would be for the courts to decide whether the restrictions imposed upon this right by the Parliament are reasonable restric- tions and are within the permissible limits prescribed by clause (5) of the article. There is no authoritative definition of the term 'Pre- ventive Detention' in Indian law, though as description of a topic of legislation it occurred in the Legislative Lists of the Government of India Act, 1935, and has been used in Item 9 of List I and Item 3 of List III in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. The expression has its origin in the language used by Judges or the law Lords in England while explaining the nature of detention under Regulation 14 (B) of the Defence of Realm Consolidation Act, 1914, passed on the outbreak of the First World War; and the same lan- guage was repeated in connection with the emergency regula- tions made during the last World War. The word ' preventive ' is used in contradistinction to the word ' punitive.' To quote the words of Lord Finlay in Rex v. Halliday(1), ""it is not a punitive but a precautionary measure."" The object is not to punish a man for having done something but to intercept him before he does it and to prevent him Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 101 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 from doing it. No offence is proved, nor any charge formulated; and the justification of such detention is suspicion (1) [1917] A.C. 260 at p. 269. or reasonable probability and not criminal conviction which can only be warranted by legal evidence (1). Detention in such form is unknown in America. It was resorted to in England only during war time but no country in the world that I am aware of has made this an integral part of their Constitution as has been done in India. This is undoubtedly unfortunate, but it is not our business to speculate on questions of policy or to attempt to explore the reasons which led the representatives of our people to make such a drastic provision in the Constitution itself, which cannot but be regarded as a most unwholesome encroachment upon the liberties of the people. The detention of a man even as a precautionary measure certainly deprives him of his personal liberty, and as article 21 guarantees to every man, be he a citizen or a foreigner, that he shall not be deprived of his life and personal liberty, except in accordance with the procedure established by law, the requirements of article 21 would certainly have to be complied with, to make preventive detention valid in law. What these requirements are I will discuss later on. Article 22 comes immediately after arti- cle 21. It secures to all persons certain fundamental rights in relation to arrest and detention, and as already said, by way of exception to the rights thus declared, makes certain specific provisions relating to preventive deten- tion. The subject of preventive detention is specified in and constitutes Item No. 9 in the Union legislative List and it also forms Item No. 3 in the Concurrent List. Under article 246 of the Constitution, the Parliament and the State Legislatures are empowered to legislate on this sub- ject within the ambit of their respective authorities. Clause(3) of article 22 expressly enjoins that the protec- tive provisions of clauses (1) and (2) of the article would not be available to persons detained under any law providing for preventive detention. The only fundamental rights which are guaranteed by the Constitution in the matter of preven- tive detention and which to that extent impose restraints upon the exercise of legislative powers in that respect are (1) Vide Lord Macmillan in Liversidge v. Anderson [1942] A.C. 206 at p. 254. contained in clauses (4) to (7) of article 22. Clause (4) lays down that no law of preventive detention shall autho- rise the detention of a person for a period longer than three months, unless an advisory board constituted in the manner laid down in sub-clause (a) of the clause has report- ed before the expiration of the period that there is suffi- cient cause for such detention. The period of detention cannot, in any event, exceed the maximum which the Parlia- ment is entitled to prescribe under clause (7) (b). The Parliament is also given the authority to prescribe the circumstances and the class of cases under which a person can be detained for a period longer than three months under any law of preventive detention without obtaining the opin- ion of the advisory board. There is one safeguard provided for all cases which is contained in clause (5) and which lays down that the authority making the order of detention shall, as soon as possible communicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order. But even here, the authority while giving the grounds of detention need not disclose such facts which it considers against public interest to disclose. The question that we have to consider is whether a law relating to preventive detention is justiciable in a Court of law on the ground of reasonableness under article 19 (5) of the Constitution inasmuch as it takes away or abridges the right to free movement in the territory of India guaran- teed by clause (1) (d)of the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 102 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 article. It will be seen from what has been said above that article 22 deals specifically with the subject of preventive detention and expressly takes away the fundamental rights relating to arrest and detention enumerated in clauses (1) and (2) of the article from per- sons who are detained under any law which may be passed by the Parliament or State Legislatures acting under article 246 of the Constitution read with the relevant items in the legislative lists. I will leave aside for the moment the question as to how far the court can examine the reasonable- ness or otherwise of the procedure that is prescribed by any law relating to preventive detention, for that would involve a considera- tion of the precise scope and meaning of article. 21; but this much is beyond controversy that so far as substantive law is concerned, article 22 of the Constitution gives a clear authority to the legislature to take away the funda- mental rights relating to arrest and detention, which are secured by the'first two clauses of the article. Any legis- lation on the subject would only have to conform to the requirements of clauses (4) to (7) and provided that is done, there is nothing in the language employed nor in the context in which it appears which affords any ground for suggestion that such law must be reasonable in its character and that it would be reviewable by the Court on that ground. Both articles 19 and 22 occur in the same Part of the Con- stitution and both of them purport to lay down the fundamen- tal rights which the Constitution guarantees. It is well settled that the Constitution must be interpreted in a broad and liberal manner giving effect to all its parts, and the presumption should be that no conflict or repugnancy was intended by its framers. In interpreting the words of a Constitution, the same principles undoubtedly apply which are applicable in construing a statute, but as was observed by Lord Wright in James v. Commonwealth of Australia ( 1 ), ""the ultimate result must be determined upon the actual words used not in vacuo but as occurring in a single complex instrument in which one part may throw light on the other."" ""The Constitution,"" his Lordship went on saying, ""has been described as the federal compact and the construction must hold a balance between all its parts."" It seems to me that there is no conflict or repugnancy between the two provisions of the Constitution and an exami- nation of the scheme and language of the catena of articles which deal with the rights to freedom would be sufficient to show that what clause (1) (d) of article 19 contemplates is not freedom from detention, either punitive or preventive; it relates to and speaks of a different aspect or phase of civil liberty. (1) [1936] A.C. 578 at p. 613. Article 19, which is the first of this series of arti- cles, enumerates seven varieties or forms of freedom begin- ning with liberty of speech and expression and ending' with free right to practise any trade, profession or business. The rights declared it articles 19 to 22 do not certainly exhaust the whole list of liberties which people possess under law. The object of the framers of the Constitution obviously is to enumerate and guarantee those forms of liberty which come under well-known categories recognised by constitutional writers and are considered to be fundamental and of vital importance to the community. There cannot be any such thing as absolute or uncon- trolled liberty wholly freed from restraint, for that would lead to anarchy and disorder. The possession and enjoyment of all rights, as was Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 103 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 observed by the Supreme Court of America in Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1), are subject to such reasonable conditions as may be deemed by the governing authority of the country essential to the safety, health, peace, general order and morals of the community. The question, therefore arises in each case of adjusting the conflicting interests of the individual and of the society. In some cases, restrictions have to be placed upon free exercise of individual rights to safeguard the interests of the society; on the other hand, social control which exists for public good has got to be restrained, lest it should be misused to the detriment of individual rights and liberties. Ordinarily, every man has the liberty to order his life as he pleases, to say what he will, to go where he will, to follow any trade, occupation or calling at his pleasure and to do any other thing which he can lawfully do without let or hindrance by any other person. On the other hand for the very protection of these liberties the society must arm itself with certain powers. No man's liberty would be worth its name if it can be violated with impunity by any wrong- doer and if his property or possessions could be preyed upon by a thief or a marauder. The society, therefore, has got to exercise certain powers for the protection of these liber- ties and to arrest, search, imprison and (1) 197 U.S. 11. punish those who break the law. If these powers are' prop- erly exercised, they themselves are the safeguards of free- dom, but they can certainly be abused. The police may arrest any man and throw him into prison without assigning any reasons; they may search his belongings on the slightest pretext; he may be subjected to a sham trial and even pun- ished for crimes unknown to law. What the Constitution, therefore, attempts to do in declaring the rights of the people is to strike a balance between individual liberty and social control. To me it seems that article 19 of the Constitution gives a list of individual liberties and prescribes in the various clauses the restraints that may be placed upon them by law, so that they may not conflict with public welfare or general morality. On the other hand articles 20, 21 and 22 are primarily concerned with penal enactments or other laws under which personal safety or liberty of persons could be taken away in the interests of the society and they set down the limits within which the State control should be exer- cised. Article 19 uses the expression ' 'freedom"" and men- tions the several forms and aspects of it which are secured to individuals, together with the limitations that could be placed upon them in the general interests of the society. Articles 20, 21 and 22 on the other hand do not make use of the expression ""freedom"" and they lay down the restrictions that are to be placed on State control where an individual is sought to be deprived of his life or personal liberty. The right to the safety of one's life and limbs and to enjoyment of personal liberty, in the sense of freedom from physical restraint and coercion of any sort, are the inher- ent birthrights of a man. The essence of these rights consists in restraining others from interfering with them and hence they cannot be described in terms of ""freedom"" to do particular things. There is also no question of imposing limits on the activities of individuals so far as the exer- cise of these rights is concerned. For these reasons, I think, these rights have not been mentioned in article 19 of the Constitution. An individual can be deprived of his life or personal liberty only by action of the State, either under the provisions of any penal enactment or in the exercise of any other coercive process vested in it under law. What the Constitution does there- fore is to put restrictions upon the powers of the State, for protecting the rights of the individuals. The re- straints on State authority operate as guarantees of indi- vidual freedom and secure to the people the enjoyment of life and personal liberty which are thus declared to be inviolable except in the manner indicated in these articles. In my opinion, the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 104 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 group of articles 20 to 22 embody the entire protection guaranteed by the Constitution in relation to deprivation of life and personal liberty both with regard to substantive as well as to procedural law. It is not correct to say, as I shah show more fully later on, that article 21 is confined to matters of procedure only. There must be a substantive law, under which the State is empow- ered to deprive a man of his life and personal liberty and such law must be a valid law which the legislature is compe- tent to enact within the limits of the powers assigned to it and which does not transgress any of the fundamental rights that the Constitution lays down. Thus a person cannot be convicted or punished under an ex post facto law, or a law which compels the accused to incriminate himself in a crimi- nal trial or punishes him for the same offence more than once. These are the protections provided for by article 20. Again a law providing for arrest and detention must conform to the limitations prescribed by clauses (1) and (2) of article 22. These provisions indeed have been withdrawn expressly in case of preventive detention and protections of much more feeble and attenuated character have been substi- tuted in their place;but this is a question of the policy adopted by the Constitution which does not concern us at all. The position, therefore, is that with regard to life and personal liberty, the Constitution guarantees protection to this extent that no man could be deprived of these rights except under a valid law passed by a competent legislature within the limits mentioned above and in accordance with the procedure which such law lays down. Article 19, on the other hand, enunciates certain particular forms of civil liberty quite independently of the rights dealt with under article 21. Most of them may be connected with or dependent upon person- al liberty but are not identical with it; and the purpose of article 19 is to indicate the limits within which the State could, by legislation, impose restrictions on the exercise of these rights by the individuals. The reasonableness or otherwise of such legislation can indeed be determined by the Court to the extent laid down in the several clauses of article 19, though no such review is permissible with regard to laws relating to deprivation of life and personal liber- ty. This may be due to the fact that life and personal freedom constitute the most vital and essential rights which people enjoy under any State and in such matters the pre- cise and definite expression of the intention of the legislature has been preferred by the Constitution to the variable standards which the judiciary might lay down. We find the rights relating to personal liberty being de- clared almost in the same terms in the Irish Consti- tution article 40 (1) (4) (1) of which lays down that ""no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law."" In the Constitution of the Free City of Danzig, ""the liberty of the person has been declared to be inviolable and no limitation or deprivation of personal liberty may be imposed by public authority except by virtue of a law"" (vide article 74). Article 31 of the Japanese Constitution is the closest parallel to article 21 of the Indian Constitution and the language is almost identical. This is the scheme adopted by the Constitution in dealing with the rights to freedom described in the chapter on fundamental rights and in my opinion, therefore, the proper test for determining the validity of an enactment under which a person is sought to be deprived of his life and personal liberty has to be found not in article 19, but in the three following articles of the Constitution. Article 20 of course has no application so far as the law relating to preventive detention is concerned. Mr. Nambiar's endeavour throughout has been to establish that article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution read with article 19 (5) enunciates the fundamental rights of the citizens regarding the substantive law of personal liberty, while article 21 embodies the protection as regards proce- dural law. This, in my opinion, would be looking at these provisions from a wrong angle altogether. Article 19 cannot Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 105 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 be said to deal with substantive law merely, nor article 21 with mere matters of procedure. It cannot also be said that the provisions of article 19 (1) (d) read with clause (5) and article 21 are complementary to each other. The con- tents and subject matter of the two provisions are not identical and they proceed on totally different princi- ples. There is no mention of any ""right to life"" in article 19, although that is the primary and the most important thing for which provision is made in article 21. If the contention of the learned counsel is correct, we would have to hold that no protection is guaranteed by the Constitution as regards right to life so far substantive law is con- cerned. In the second place, even if freedom of movement may be regarded as one of the ingredients of personal liberty, surely there are other elements included in the concept and admittedly no provision for other forms of personal liberty are to be found in article 19 (5) of the Constitution. Furthermore article 19 is applicable to citizens only, while the rights guaranteed by article 21 are for all per- sons. citizens as well as aliens. The only proper way of avoiding these anomalies is to interpret the two provisions as applying to different subjects and this would be the right conclusion if we have in mind the scheme which under- lies this group of articles. I will now turn to the language of article 19 (1) (d) and see whether preventive detention really comes within its purview. Article 19 (1) (d) provides that all citizens shall have the right to move freely throughout the territory of India. The two sub-clauses which come immediately after sub-clause (d) and are intimately connected with it, are in these terms: ""(e) To reside and settle in any part of the territory of India; (f) to acquire, hold and dispose of property."" Clause (5)relates to all these three sub-clauses and lays down that nothing in them shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub- clause either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any scheduled tribe. I agree with the learned Attorney-General that in con- struing article 19 (1) (d) stress is to be laid upon the expression ""throughout the territory of India,"" and it is a particular and special kind of right, viz., that of free movement throughout the Indian territory, that is the aim and object of the Constitution to secure. In the next sub- clause, right tO reside and settle ""in any part of the territory of India"" is given and here again the material thing is not the right of residence or settlement but the right to reside or settle in any part of the Indian territo- ry. For an analogous provision, we may refer to article 301 which says that subject to the other provisions of this Part, commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India shall be free. The meaning of sub-clause (d) of arti- cle 19 (1) will be clear if we take it along with sub- clauses (e) and (f), all of which have been lumped together in clause (5) and to all of which the same restrictions including those relating to protecion of the interest of any scheduled tribe have been made applicable. It will be remembered that these rights are available only to citizens. To an alien or foreigner, no guarantee of such rights has been given. Normally all citizens would have the free right to move from one part of the Indian territory to another. They can shift their residence from one place to any other place of their choice and settle anywhere they like. The right of free trade, commerce and intercourse throughout the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 106 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 territory of India is also secured. What the Constitu- tion emphasises upon by guaranteeing these rights is that the whole of Indian Unian in spite of its being divided into a number of States is really one unit as far as the citizens of the Union are concerned. All the citizens would have the same privileges and the same facilities for moving into any part of the territory and they can reside or carry on business anywhere they like; and no restrictions either inter-State or otherwise would be allowed to set up in these respects between one part of India and another. So far as free movement throughout the territory is concerned, the right is subject to the provision of clause (5), under which reasonable limitation may be imposed upon these liberties in the interests of the general public or protection of any scheduled tribe. The interests of the public which necessitates such restrictions may be of var- ious kinds. They may be connected with the avoidance of pestilence or spreading of contagious diseases; certain places 'again may be kept closed for military purposes and there may be prohibition of entry into areas which are actual or potential war zones or where disturbances of some kind or other prevail. Whatever the reasons might be, it is necessary that these restrictions must be reasonable, that is to say, commensurate with the purpose for which they are laid down. In addition to general interest, the Constitu- tion has specified the protection of the interests of the scheduled tribes as one of the factors which has got to be taken into consideration in the framing of these restric- tions. The scheduled tribes, as is well known, are a back- ward and unsophisticated class of people who are liable to be imposed upon by shrewd and designing persons. Hence there are various provisions disabling them from alienating even their own properties except under special conditions. In their interest and for their benefit, laws may be made restricting the ordinary right of citizens to go or settle in particular areas or acquire property in them. The refer- ence to the interest of scheduled tribe makes it quite clear-that the free movement spoken of in the clause relates not to general rights of locomotion but to the particular right of shifting or moving from one part of the Indian territory to another, without any sort of discriminatory barriers. This view will receive further support if we look to some analogous provisions ,in the Constitution of other countries. It will be seen that sub-clauses (d) (e) and (f)of article 19 (1) are embodied in almost identical language in one single article, viz., article 75 of the Constitution of the Free City of Danzig. The article runs as follows: ""All nationals shall enjoy freedom of movement within the free city and shall have the right to stay and to settle at any place they may choose, to acquire real property and to earn their living in any way. This right shall not be curtailed without legal sanctions."" The several rights are thus mentioned together as being included in the same category, while they are differentiated from the ""liberty of the person"" which is ""described to be inviolable except by virtue of a law"" in article 74 which appears just previous to this article. An analogous provi- sion in slightly altered language occurs in article 111 of the Constitution of the German Reich which is worded in the following manner: All Germans enjoy the right of change of domicile within the whole Reich. Every one has the right to stay in any part of the Realm that he chooses, t6 settle there, acquire Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 107 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 landed property and pursue any means of livelihood."" Here again the right to personal liberty has been dealt with separately in article 114. A suggestion was made in course of our discussions that the expression ""throughout the territory of India"" occurring in article 19 (1) (d) might have been used with a view to save Passport Regulations or to emphasise that no rights of free emigration are guaran- teed by the Constitution. The suggestion does not seem to me to be proper. No State can guarantee to its citizens the. free right to do anything outside its own territory.This is true of all the fundamental rights men- tioned in article 19 and not merely of the right of free movement. Further it seems to me that the words ""throughout the territory of India"" have nothing to do with rights of emigration. We find that both in the Danzig as well as in the German Constitution, where similar words have been used with regard to the excercise of the right of free movement throughout the. territory, there are specific provisions which guarantee to all nationals the free right of emigration to other coun- tries (vide article 76 of the Danzig Constitution and arti- cle 112 of the Constitution of the German Reich). In my opinion, therefore, preventive detention does not come either within the express language or within the spirit and intendment of clause (1) (d) of article 19 of the Constitu- tion which deals with a totally different aspect or form of civil liberty. It is true that by reason of preventive detention, a man may be prevented from exercising the right of free movement within the territory of India as contemplated by article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution, but that is merely incidental to or consequential upon loss of liberty resulting from the order of detention. Not merely the right under clause (1) (d), but many of the other rights which are enumerated under the other-sub-clauses of article 19 (1) may be lost or suspended so long as preventive detention continues. Thus a detenu so long as he is under detention may not be able to practise any profession, or carry on any trade or business which he might like to do; but this would not make the law providing for preventive detention a legislation taking away or abridging the rights under article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution and it would be absurd to suggest that in such cases the validity of the legislation should be tested in accordance with the requirement of clause (6) of article 19'and that the only restrictions that could be placed upon the person's free exercise of trade and profession are those specified in that clause. Mr. Nambiar concedes that in such cases we must look to the substance of the particular legis- lation and the mere fact that it incidentally trenches upon some other right to which it does not directly relate is not material. He argues, however, that the essence or substance of a legislation which provides for preventive detention is to take away or curtail the right of free move- ments and in fact, ""personal liberty"" according to him, connotes nothing else but unrestricted right of locomotion. The learned counsel refers in this connection to certain passages in Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of Eng- land, where the author discusses what he calls the three Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 108 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 absoluterights inherent in every Englishman, namely, rights of personal security, personal liberty and property. ""Personal security"", according to Blackstone, consists in a person's legal and uninterrupted enjoyment of his life, his limb, his body, his health and his reputation; whereas ""personal liberty"" consists in the power of locomotion, of changing of situation or moving one's person to whatsoever place one's own inclination may direct without imprisonment or restraint unless by due course of law (1). It will be seen that Blackstone uses the expression ""personal liberty"" in a somewhat narrow and restricted sense. A much wider and larger connotation is given to it by later writers on con- stitutional documents, particularly in America. In ordinary language ""personal liberty"" means liberty relating to or concerning the person or body of the individual; and ""per- sonal liberty"" in this sense is the antithesis of physical restraint or coercion. According to Dicey, who is an acknowledged authority on the subject ""personal liberty"" means a personal right not to be subjected to imprisonment, arrest or other physical coercion in any manner that does not admit of legal justification(2). It is, in my opinion, this negative right of not being subjected to any form of physical restraint or coercion that constitutes the essence of personal liberty and not mere freedom to move to any part of the Indian territory. In this connection, it may not be irrelevant to. point out that it was in accordance with the recommendation of the'Drafting Committee that the word ""personal"" was inserted before ""liberty"" in article 15 of the Constitution which now stands as article 21. In the report of the Drafting Commit- tee it is stated that the word ""liberty"" should be quali- fied by the insertion of the word ""personal"" before it; otherwise, it might be construed very widely so as to in- clude even the freedoms already dealt with in article 13. Article. 13, it should be noted, is the present article 19. If the views of the Drafting Committee were accepted by the (1) Vide Chase's Blackstone, 4th Edn, pp. 68, 73. (2) Vide Dicey on Constitutional Law, 9th Edn, pp. 207-208. Constituent Assembly, the intention obviously was to exclude the contents of article 19. from the concept of ""personal liberty"" as used in article 21. To -what extent the meaning of words used in the Constitution could be discovered from reports of Drafting Committee or debates on the floor of the House is a matter not quite free from doubt and I may have to take up this matter later on when discussing the meaning of the material clause in article 21 of the Constitution. It is enough to say at this stage that if the report of the Drafting Committee is an appropriate material upon which the interpretation of the words of the Constitution could be based, it certainly goes against the contention of the applicant and it shows that the words used in article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution do not mean the same thing as the expression ""personal liberty"" in article 21 does. It is well known that the word ""'liberty"" standing by itself has been given a very wide meaning by the Supreme Court of the United States of America. It includes not only personal freedom from physical restraint but the right to the free use of one's own property and to enter into free contractual relations, In the Indian Constitution, on the other hand, the expression ""personal liberty"" has been deliberately used to restrict it to freedom from physical restraint of person by incarceration or otherwise. Apart from the report of the Drafting Committee, that is the plain Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 109 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 grammatical meaning of the expression as I have already explained. It may not, I think, be quite accurate to state that the operation of article 19 of the Constitution is limited to free citizens only and that the rights have been described in that article on the presupposition that the citizens are at liberty. The deprivation of personal liberty may entail as a consequence the loss or abridgement of many of the rights described in article 19, but that is because the nature of these rights is such that free exercise of them is not possible in the absence of personal liberty. On the other hand, the right to hold and dispose of property which is in subclause (f) of article 19 (1) and which is not dependent on full possession of personal liberty by the owner may not be affected if the owner is imprisoned or detained. Anyway, the point is not of much importance for purposes of the present discussion. The result is that, in my opinion, the first contention raised by Mr. Nambiar cannot succeed and it must be held that we are not entitled to examine the reasonableness or otherwise of the Preventive Detention Act and see whether it is within the permissible bounds specified in clause (5) of article 19. I now come to the second point raised by Mr. Nambiar in support of the application; and upon this point we had arguments of a most elaborate nature addressed to us by the learned counsel on both sides, displaying a considerable amount of learning and research. The point, however, is a short one and turns upon the interpretation to be put upon article 21 of the Constitution, which lays down that ""no person shall be deprived of his ........ personal liberty, except according to procedure established by law."" On a plain reading of the article the meaning seems to be that you cannot deprive a man of his personal liberty, unless you follow and act according to the law which provides for deprivation of such liberty. The expression ""procedure"" means the manner and form of enforcing the law. In my opinion, it cannot be disputed that in order that there may be a legally established procedure, the law which establish- es it must be a valid and lawful law which the legislature is competent to enact in accordance with article 245 of the Constitution and the particular items in the legislative lists which it relates to. It is also not disputed that such law must not offend against the fundamental rights which are declared in Part III of the Constitution. The position taken up by the learned Attorney-General is that as in the present case there is no doubt about the competency of that Parliament to enact the law relating to preventive detention which is fully covered by Item 9 of List I, and Item 3 of List III, and as no question of the law being reasonable or otherwise arises for consideration by reason of the fact that article 19 (1) (d) is not attracted to this case, the law must be held to be a valid piece of legisla- tion and if the procedure laid down by it has been adhered to, the validity of the detention cannot possibly be challenged. His further argu- ment is that article 22 specifically provides for preventive detention and lays down fully what the requirements of a legislation on the subject should be. As the impugned Act conforms to the requirements of article 22, no further ques- tion of its validity under article 21 of the Constitution at all arises. The latter aspect of his arguments, I will deal with later on. So far as the main argument is concerned,the position taken up by Mr. Nambiar is that article 21 refers to 'procedure only and not to substan- tive law the procedure, however, must be one which is established by law. The expression ""law"" in this context does not mean or signify, according to the learned counsel, any particular law enacted by the legislature in conformity with the requirements of the Constitu- tion or otherwise possessing a binding authority. It refers to law in the abstract or general sense--in the sense of jus and not lex--and meaning thereby the legal principles or fundamental rules that lie at the root of every Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 110 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 system of positive law including our own, and the authority of which is acknowledged in the jurisprudence of all civilised coun- tries. It is argued that if the word ""law"" is interpret- ed in the sense of any State-made law, article 21 could not rank as a fundamental right imposing a check or limitation on the legislative authority of the Government. It will be always competent to the legislature to pass a law laying down a thoroughly arbitrary and irrational procedure opposed to all elementary principles of justice and fairness and the people would have no protection whatsoever, provided such procedure was scrupulously adhered to. In support of this argument the learned counsel has relied upon a large number of American cases, where the Supreme Court of America ap- plied the doctrine of ""due process of law"" as it appears in the American Constitution for the purpose of invalidating various legislative enactments which appeared to that Court to be capricious and arbitrary and opposed to the fundamen- tal principles of law. It may be noted here that in the original draft of the Indian Constitution the words used in article 15 (which now stands as article 21) were ""in accordance with due process of law."" The Drafting Committee recommended that in place of the ""due process"" clause, the expression ""according to procedure established by law"" should be substituted. The present article 21 seems to have been modeled on article 31 of the Japanese Constitution, where the language employed is ""no person shall be deprived of'life or liberty, nor shall any other criminal penalty be imposed, except according to procedure established by law."" Mr. Nambiar argues that the expression ""procedure established by law"" in article 21 of the Constitution bears the same meaning as the ""due process"" clause does in America, restricted only to this extent, viz., that it is limited to matters of procedure and does not extend to questions of substantive law. To appre- ciate the arguments that have been advanced for and against this view and to fix the precise meaning that is to be given to this clause in article 21, it would be necessary to discuss briefly the conception of the doctrine of ""due process of law"" as it appears in the American Constitution and the way in which it has been developed and applied by the Supreme Court of America. In the history of Anglo-American law, the concept of ""due process of law"" or what is considered to be its equiva- lent ""law of the land"" traces its lineage far back into the beginning of the 13th century A.D. The famous 39th chapter of the Magna Charta provides that ""no free man shall be taken or imprisoned or disseized, or outlawed or exiled or in any way destroyed; nor shall we go upon him nor send upon him but by the lawful judgment of his peers and by the law of the land."" Magna Charta as a charter of English liberty was confirmed by successive English monarchs and it is in one of these confirmations (28 Ed. III, Chap. 3) known as ""Statute of Westminster of the liberties of London"", that the expression ""due process of law"" for the first time appears. Neither of these phrases was explained or defined in any of the -documents, but on the authority of Sir Edward Coke it may be said that both the expressions have the same meaning. In substance, they guaranteed that persons should not be imprisoned without proper indictment and trial by peers, and that property should not be seized except in proceedings conducted in due form in which the owner or the person in possession should have an opportunity to show cause why seizure should not be made (1). These concepts came into America as part of the rights of Englishmen claimed by the colonists. The expression in one form or other appeared in some of the earlier State Constitutions and the exact phrase ""due process of law"" came to be a part of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 111 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 the Federal Constitution by the Fifth Amendment which was adopted in 1791 and which provided that ""no person shall... be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law."" It was imposed upon the State Constitution in almost identical language by the Fourteenth Amendment in the year 1868. What ""due process of law"" exactly means is difficult to define even at the present day, The Constitution contains no description of what is ""due process of law"" nor does it declare the principles by application of which it could be ascertained. In Twining v. New Jersey (2) the Court ob- served: ""Few phrases in the law are so elusive of exact appre- hension as this. This COurt has always declined to give a comprehensive definition of it and has preferred that its full meaning should be gradually ascertained by the process of inclusion and exclusion in the course of the decisions of cases as they arise."" It is clear, however, that the requirement of ""due process of law"" in the United States Constitution imposes a limitation upon all the powers of Government, legislative as well as executive and judicial. Applied in England only as protection against executive usurpation and royal tyranny, in America it became a bulwark against arbitrary legislation (3). (1) Vide Willoughby on the Constitution of the United States, Vol. III, p. 1087. (2) 211 U.S. 79. (3) Vide Hurtando v. People of California, 110 U.S. 516 at p. 532. As it is a restraint upon the legislative power and the- object is to protect citizens against arbitrary and capri- cious legislation, it is not within the competence of the Congress to make any process a ""due process of law"" by its mere will; for that would make the limitation quite nugato- ry. As laid down in the case cited above, ""it is not any act legislative in form that is law; law is something more than mere will exerted as an act of power."" It means and signifies the general law of the land, the settled and abid- ing principles which inhere in the Constitution and lie at the root of the entire legal system. To quote the words of Daniel Webster in a famous argument before.the Supreme Court (1): ""By the law of the land is most clearly intended the general law--a law which hears before it condemns, which proceeds upon enquiry and renders judgment only after trial. The meaning is that every citizen shall hold his life, liberty, property and immunities under the protection of the general rules which govern society."" What these principles of general law are nobody has ever attempted to enumerate. To a large extent they are the principles of English common law and modes of judicial pro- ceedings obtaining in England, the traditions of which came along with the settlers in America. Some Judges seem to have alluded to the principles of natural justice in ex- plaining what is meant by general law or ""law of the land,"" Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 112 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 though the doctrine of a law of nature did not obtain a firm footing at any time. In Wynehamer v. New York (2), Justice Hubbard declared himself opposed to the judiciary attempting to set bounds to the legislative authority or declaring a statute invalid upon any fanciful theory of'higher law or first principles of natural right outside of the Constitu- tion. Coke's dictum of a supreme fundamental law which obviously referred to principles of English common law cer- tainly did exercise considerable influence upon the minds of the American Judges (3) and there are observations in some cases (1) Darmouth College case, 4 Wheaton p. 518. (2) 13 N.Y. 379. (3) Willis on Constitutional Law, p. 647. which go to suggest that the principles of natural justice were regarded as identical with those of common law, except where the rules of common law were not considered to be of fundamental character or were not acted upon as being un- suited to the progress of time or conditions of the American Society (1). In the case of Loan Association v. Topeka (2), it was observed that there are limitations upon powers of Government which grow out of the essential nature of free Governments--implied reservations of individual rights without which the social compact could not exist and which are respected by all Governments entitled to the name. What is hinted at, is undoubtedly the old idea of a social com- pact under which political institutions were supposed to come into being; and the suggestion is that when the Ameri- cans formed themselves into a State by surrendering a por- tion of their rights which they possessed at that time and which presumably they inherited from their English ancestors, there were certain rights of a fundamental character still reserved by them which no State could possibly take away. As has been said already, ""due process of law"" has never been defined by Judges or Jurists in America. The best description of the expression would be to say that it means in each particular case such an exercise of the powers of Government as the settled maxims of law permit and sanction, and under such safeguards for the protection of individual rights as those maxims prescribe for the class of cases to which the one in question belongs (3). In the actual application of the clause relating to ""due process of law"" to particular cases the decisions of the Supreme Court of America present certain peculiar and unusu- al features and there is total lack of uniformity and consistency in them. Ever since the appearance of the clause in the Fifth Amendment and down to the middle of the 19th century, it was interpreted as a restriction on proce- dure, and particularly the judicial procedure, by which the Government (1) Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, Vol. II, p. 73940. (2) 20 Wall, p. 655. (3) Cooley's Constitutional Limita- tions, Vol. II, p. 741. exercises its powers. Principally it related to the proce- dure by which persons were tried for crimes and guaranteed to accused persons the right to have a fair trial in compli- ance with well established criminal proceedings. The same principle applied to the machinery or proceeding by which property rights were adjudicated and by which the powers of eminent domain and taxation were exercised. During this period it was not considered to have any bearing on substan- tial law at all. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 113 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 Change, however, came in and the period that followed witnessed a growing recognition of the doctrine that sub- stantive rights of life, liberty and property are protected by the requirement of due process of law against any depri- vation attempted at by legislative authority; and the polit- ical and economic conditions of the country accounted to a great extent for this change in judicial outlook. The close of the civil war brought in a new period of industrial development leading to accumulation of large capital in the hands of industrialists and the emergence of a definite labouring class. New and important problems arose which the States attempted to deal with by various laws and regu- lations. Some of them seem to have been ill-advised and arbitrary and there was a clamour amongst businessmen against what they described as legislative encroachments upon their vested private rights. The Supreme Court now began to use the rule of due process of law as a direct restraint upon substantial legislation and any statute or administrative act, which imposed a limitation upon rights of private property or free contractual relations between the employers and employed, was invalidated as not being in accordance with due process of law (1). What constituted a legitimate exercise of the powers of legislation now came to be a judicial question and no statute was valid unless it was. reasonable in the opinion of the Court. The question of reasonableness obviously depends largely upon the. ideas of particular individuals and the Courts or rather the majority of Judges thus marshalled their own (1) Vide Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences, Vol. V, pp. 265-67. views of social and economic policy in deciding the reasona- bleness or otherwise of the statutes. In the language of a well-known writer, the Courts became a kind of negative third chamber both to the State Legislatures and the Con- gress(1). To what extent the Courts laid stress upon the doctrine of freedom of contract is illustrated in the case of Lochner v. New York(2). In that case the question arose as to the validity of a labour legislation which prohibited the employment of persons in certain fields of activity for more than 60 hours a week. Lochner was indicted for violat- ing this law by employing a man in his Biscuit and Cake Factory who was to work more than 60 hours in a week. The Court by a majority of 5 to 4 held the statute to be invalid on the ground that the ""right to purchase or sell labour is part of the liberty protected by the Amendment unless there are circumstances which excluded the right."" That decision has been criticized not merely on the ground that it rested upon an economic theory which to quote the language of Holmes J., who was one of the dissentient Judges ""was not entertained by a large part of the country;"" but it ignored that such regulation was necessary for protecting the health of the employees, that is to say, it was in substance an exercise of police powers with a view to accomplish some object of public interest(s). It may be mentioned here that while the due process doctrine was being extended by judicial pronouncements, the doctrine of police power which operates to some extent as a check upon the ""due process"" clause was simultaneously gaining importance. Roughly speaking, police power may be defined as ""a right of a Government to regulate the conduct of its people in the interests of public safety, health, morals and convenience. Under this authority, a Government may make regulations concerning the safety of building, the regulation of traffic, the reporting of incurable diseases, the inspection of markets, the sanitation of factories, the hours of work for women (1) Vide Kelley and Harbinson on the American Constitution, p. 539. 198 u.s. 45.

Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 Vide Willoughby on the Constitution of the U.S., Vol. III, p. 271. and children, the sale of intoxicants and such other matters ,,(1). Here again, the extent to which the Court can inter- fere with exercise of police powers by the State has not been clearly defined by judicial pronouncements. The doc- trine generally accepted is that although any enactment by legislature under the guise of exercise of police powers would not necessarily be constitutional, yet if the regula- tion has a direct relation to its proposed object which is the accomplishment of some legitimate public purpose, the wisdom or policy of the legislation should not be examined by the Courts. The rule is not without its exceptions but it is not necessary to elaborate them for our present pur- pose(2). The later decisions, though not quite uniform, reveal the growing influence of the police power doctrine. It may be said that since 1936 there has been a definite swing of the judicial pendulum in the other direction. In the case of West Coast Hotel Company v. Parrish(3) which related to the legality of a Statute for regulating the minimum wages of women, Chief Justice Hughes, who delivered the opinion of the Court, observed as follows: ""In each case the violation alleged by those attack- ing minimum wage regulation for women is deprivation of freedom of contract. What is the freedom? The Constitution does not speak of freedom of contract. It speaks of liberty and prohibits the deprivation of liberty without due process of law. In prohibiting that deprivation the Constitution does not recognise an absolute and uncontrol- lable liberty. Liberty in each of its phases has its histo- ry and connotation. But the liberty safeguarded is liberty in a social organisation which requires the protection of law. against the evils which menace the health, safety, morals and welfare of the people."" In the succeeding years the indications certainly are that the requirement of due process of law as a substantial restriction on Government control is becoming a thing of the past and the rule is being restricted more (1) Vide Munroe--The Government of the U.S., p. 522. (2) Vide Willoughby on the Constitution of the U.S. Vol. III, pp. 1709-70. (3) 300 U.S. 379. and more to its original procedural meaning. What will happen in future cannot certainly be predicted at this stage(1). Thus it will be seen that the ""due process"" clause in the American Constitution came to be used as a potent in- strument in the hands of the judiciary for exercising con- trol over social legislation. The judicial pronouncements are not guided by any uniform principle, and the economic and social ideas of the Judges, who form the majority in the Supreme Court for the time being, constitute, so to say, the yard-stick for measuring the reasonableness or otherwise of any enactment passed during that period. No writer of American Constitutional Law has been able uptil now to evolve anything like a definite and consistent set of prin- ciples out of the large mass of cases, where the doctrine of ""due process of law"" has been invoked or applied. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 115 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 It is against this background that we must consider how the constitution-makers in India dealt with and gave final shape to the provisions, on an analogous subject in the Indian Constitution. In the Draft Constitution, article 15 (which now stands as article 21) was apparently framed on the basis of the 5th and 14th Amendments in the American Constitution. The article was worded as follows: ""No person shall be deprived of his life or liberty without due process of law."" The Drafting Committee in their report recommended a change in the language of this article. The first sugges- tion was that the word ""personal"" shall be inserted before the word ""liberty"" and the second was that the expression ""in accordance with procedure established by law"" shall be substituted for ""due process of law,"" the reason given being that the former expression was more specific. The learned Attorney-General has placed before us the debates in the Constituent Assembly centering round the adoption of this recommendation of the Drafting Committee and he has referred us to the (1) Swisher--The Growth of Constitutional Power in the United States, pp. 123-25. speeches of several members of the Assembly who played an important part in the shaping of the Constitution. As an aid to discover the meaning of the words in a Consti- tution, these debates are of doubtful value. ''Resort can be had to them""' says Willoughby, ''with great caution and only when latent ambiguities are to be solved. The proceed- ings may be of some value when they clearly point out the purpose of the provision. But when the question is of ab- stract meaning, it will be difficult to derive from this source much material assistance in interpretation""(1). The learned Attorney-General concedes that these debates are not admissible to explain the meaning of the words used and he wanted to use them only for the purpose of showing that the Constituent Assembly when they finally adopted the recommendation of the Drafting Committee, were fully aware of the implications of the differences between the old form of expression and the new. In my opinion, in interpreting the Constitution, it will be better if such extrinsic evi- dence is left out of account. In matters like this, differ- ent members act upon different impulses and from different motives and it is quite possible that some members accepted certain words in a particular sense, while others took them in a different light. The report of the Drafting Committee, however,has been relied upon by both parties and there are decided authori- ties in which a higher value has been attached to such reports than the debates on the floor of the House. In Caminetti v. United States (2), it is said that reports to Congress accompanying the introduction of proposed law may aid the Courts in reaching the true meaning of the legisla- tion in case of doubtful interpretation. The report is extremely short. It simply says that the reason for the suggested change is to make the thing more specific. I have no doubt in my mind that if the ""due process"" clause which appeared in the original draft was finally retained by the Constituent Assembly, it could be safely presumed that the framers of the Indian (1) Vide Willoughby on the Constitution of the United States, p. 64. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 116 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 (2) 242 U.S. 470. Constitution wanted that expression to bear the same sense as it does in America. But when that form was abandoned and another was deliberately substituted in its place, it is not possible to say that in spite of the difference in the language and expression, they should mean the same thing and convey the same idea. Mr. Nambiar's contention is that in view of the somewhat uncertain and fluidic state of law as prevails in America on the subject, the Drafting Committee recommended an alteration for the purpose of making the language more specific and he would have us hold that it was made specific in this way, namely, that instead of being extended over the whole sphere of law, substantive as well as adjective, it was limited to procedural law mere- ly. That is the reason, he says, why instead of the word ""process"" the expression ""procedure"" was adopted, but the word ""law"" means the same thing as it does in the ""due process"" clause in America and refers not to any State-made law but to the fundamental principles which are inherent in the legal system and are based upon the immutable doctrines of natural justice. Attractive though this argument might at first sight appear, I do not think that it would be possible to accept it as sound. In the first place, it is quite clear that the framers of the Indian Constitution did not desire to intro- duce into our system the elements of uncertainty, vagueness and changeability that have grown round the ""due process"" doctrine in America. They wanted to make the provision clear, definite and precise and deliberately chose the words"" procedure established by law,"" as in their opinion no doubts would ordinarily arise about the meaning of this expression. The indefiniteness in the application of the ""due process"" doctrine in America has nothing to do with the distinction between substantive and procedural law. The uncertainty and elasticity are in the doctrine itself which is a sort of hidden mine, the contents of which nobody knows and is merely revealed from time to time to the. judicial conscience of the Judges. This theory, the Indian Constitu- tion deliberately discarded and that is why they substituted a different form in its place which, according to them, was more specific. In the second place, it appears to me that when the same words are not used, it will be against the ordinary canons of con- struction to interpret a provision in our Constitution in accordance with the interpretation put upon a somewhat analogous provision in the Constitution of another country, where not only the language is different, but the entire political conditions and constitutional set-up are dissimi- lar. In the Supreme Court of America, stress has been laid uniformly upon the word ""due"" which occurs before and quali- fies the expression ""process of law."" ""Due"" means "" what is just and proper"" according to the circumstances of a particular case. It is this word which introduces the varia- ble element in the application of the doctrine; for what is reasonable in one set of circumstances may not be so in another and a different set. In the Indian Constitution the word ""due"" has been deliberately omitted and this shows clearly that the Constitution-makers of India had no inten- tion of introducing the American doctrine. The word ""estab- lished"" ordinarily means ""fixed or laid down"" and if ""law"" means, as Mr. Nambiar contends, not any particular piece of law Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 117 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 but the indefinite and indefinable principles of natural justice which underlie positive systems of law, it would not at all be appropriate to use the expression ""established,"" for natural law or natural justice cannot establish anything like a definite procedure. It does not appear that in any part of the Constitution the word ""law"" has been used in the sense of ""general law"" connoting what has been described as the principles of natural justice outside the realm of positive law. On the other hand, the provision of' article 31 of the Constitu- tion, which appears in the. chapter on Fundamental Rights, makes it clear that the word ""law"" is equivalent to State- made law and to deprive a person of his property, the au- thority or sanction of such law is necessary. As has been said already, the provision of article 21 of. the Indian Constitution reproduces, save in one particular, the- language of article 31 of the Japanese Constitution and it is quite clear from the scheme and provisions of the Japa- nese Constitution that in speaking of law it refers to law passed or recognised as such by the State. In the Irish Constitution also, there is provision in almost similar language which conveys the same idea. Article 40 (4) (1) provides that ""no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law,"" and by law is certain- ly meant the law of the State. Possibly the strongest argument in support of Mr. Nambi- ar's contention is that if law is taken to mean State-made law, then article 21 would not be a restriction on legisla- tion at all. No question of passing any law abridging the right conferred by this article could possibly arise and article 13 (2) of the Constitution would have no operation so far as this provision is concerned. To quote the words of an American Judge it would sound very much like the Constitution speaking to the legislature that the latter could not infringe the right created by these articles unless it chose to do so (1). Apparently this is a plausible argument but it must be admitted that we are not concerned with the policy of the Constitution. The fundamental rights not merely impose limitations upon the legislature, but they serve as checks on the exercise of executive powers as well, and in the matter of depriving a man of his personal liberty, checks on the high-handedness of the executive in the shape of pre- venting them from taking any step, which is not in accord- ance with law, could certainly rank as fundamental rights. In the Constitutions of various other countries, the provi- sions relating to protection of personal liberty are couched very much in the same language as in article 21. It is all a question of policy as to whether the legislature or the judiciary would have the final say in such matters and the Constitution-makers of India deliberately decided to place these powers in the hands of the legislature. Article 31 of the Japanese Constitution, upon which article 21 of our Constitution is modelled, also (1) Vide per Bronson 5. in Taylor v. Porte 4 Hill 1<0. proceeds upon the same principle. The Japanese Constitu- tion, it is to be noted, guarantees at the same. time other rights in regard to arrest, detention and access to Court which might serve as checks on legislative authority as well. Thus article 32 provides: Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 118 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 ""No person shall be denied the right of access to the Courts."" Article 34 lays down: ""No person shall be arrested or detained without being at once informed of the charges against him or without the immediate privilege of counsel, nor shall he be detained without adequate cause; and upon demand of any person, such cause must be immediately shown in open Court in his presence and in the. presence of his counsel."" It was probably on the analogy of article 34 of the Japanese Constitution that the first two clauses of article 22 of the Indian Constitution were framed. Article 22 was not in the original Draft Constitution at all; and after the ""due process"" clause was discarded by the Constituent Assem- bly and the present form was substituted in its place in article 21, article 22 was introduced with a view to provide for some sort of' check in matters of arrest and detention and the protection it affords places limitations upon the authority of the legislature as well. These protections indeed have been denied to cases of preventive detention but that again is a question of policy which does not concern us as a Court. My conclusion, therefore, is that in article 21 the word ""law"" has been used in the sense of State-made law and not as an equivalent of law in the abstract or general sense embodying the principles of natural justice. The article presupposes that the law is a valid and binding law under the provisions. of the Constitution having regard to the competency of the legislature and the subject it relates to and does not infringe any of the fundamental rights which the Constitution provides for. In the view that I have taken, the question raised by Mr. Nambiar that the Preventive Detention Act is invalid, by reason of the fact that the procedure it lays down is not in conformity with the rules of natural justice, does not fall for consideration. It is enough, in my opin- ion, if the law is a valid law which the legislature is competent to pass and which does not transgress any of the fundamental rights declared in Part III of the Constitution. It is also unnecessary to enter into a discussion on the question raised by the learned Attorney-General as to wheth- er article 22 by itself is a self-contained Code with regard to the law of Preventive Detention and whether or not the procedure it lays down is exhaustive. Even if the procedure is not exhaustive, it is not permissible to supplement it by application of the rules of natural justice. On the third point raised by Mr. Nambiar, the only question, therefore, which requires consideration is whether section 12 of the Preventive Detention Act is ultra vires of the Constitution by reason of its being not in conformity with the provision of article 22 (7)(a). Article 22 (7) (a) of the Constitution empowers the Parliament to prescribe the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preventive detention without obtaining the opinion of an advisory board in accordance with the provisions of sub-clause (a) of clause (4). Section 12 of the Preventive Detention Act which purports to be an enact- ment in pursuance of article 22 (7) (a) of the Constitution provides as follows: ""(1) Any person detained in any of the following classes of cases or under any of the following circumstances may be detained without obtaining the opinion of an Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 119 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 advisory board for a period longer than three months, but not exceeding one year from the date of his detention, namely, where such person has been detained with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to (a) the defence of India, relations of India with for- eign powers or the security of India; or (b) the security of a State or the maintenance of public order."" It will be noticed that there are altogether six heads or subjects in the two Items in the legislative lists, namely, Item No. 9 of List I and Item No. 3 of List III which deal with preventive detention. Item No. 9 of List I mentions reasons connected with defence, foreign affairs and security of India, while Item No. 3 of List III speaks of reasons connected with security of a State, the maintenance of public order and the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community. With the exception of the last head; all the remaining five have been listed in section 12 of the preventive Detention Act and they have been mentioned both as circumstances and classes of cases in which deten- tion for more than three months would be permissible without the opinion of any advisory board. Mr. Nambiar's argument is that the mentioning_ of five out of the six legislative heads in section 12 does not amount to prescribing the circumstances under which, or the classes of cases in which, a person could be detained for more than three months as contemplated by article 22 (7) (a). It is also contended that in view of the fact that the two items ""circumstances"" and ""classes"" are separated by the conjunction ""and,"" what the Constitution really contemplated was that both these items should be specified and a statement or specification of any one of them would not be a proper compliance with the provisions of the clause. It is further pointed out that the mentioning of the same matters as ""circumstances"" or ""classes"" is not warranted by article 22 (7) of the Consti- tution and is altogether illogical and unsound. I must say that section 12 has been drafted in a rather clumsy manner and certainly it could have been framed in a better and more proper way. Under article 22(7)(a), the Parliament may specify the circumstances under which, and the classes of cases in which, the necessity of placing the cases of detention for examination by the advisory board could be dispensed with. By ""classes of cases"" we mean certain determinable groups, the individuals comprised in each group being related to one another in a particular way which constitutes the determining factor of that group. ""Circumstances"" on the other hand connote situations or conditions which are external to the persons concerned. Preventive detention can be provided for by law for reasons connected with six different ,matters specified in the relevant items in the legislative lists, and whatever the reasons might be, there is a provision contained in article 22 (4) (a) which lays down that deten- tion for more than three months could not be permitted except with the sanction of the advisory board. An alterna- tive however has been provided for by clause (b) and Parlia- ment has been given the option to take away the protection given by clause (a) and specify the circumstances and the cases when this rule will not apply. I am extremely doubt- ful whether the classification of cases made by Parliament in section 12 of the Act really fulfils the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 120 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 object which the Constitution had in view. The basis of classification has been the apprehended acts of the persons detained described with reference to the general heads mentioned in the items in the legislative lists as said above. Five out of the six heads have been taken out and labelled as classes of cases to which the protection of clause (4) (a) of the article would not be available. It is against common sense that all forms of activities connected with these five items are equally dangerous and merit the same drastic treatment. The descriptions are very general and there may be acts of various degrees of intensity and danger under each one of these heads. Although I do not think that section 12 has been framed with due regard to the object which the Constitution had in view, I am unable to say that the section is invalid as being ultra vires the Constitution. The Constitution has given unfettered powers to Parliament in the matter of making the classifications and it is open to the Parliament to adopt any method or principle as it likes. If it chose the principle implied in the enumeration of subjects under the relevant legislative heads, it cannot be said that Parliament has exceeded its powers. I am also unable to hold that both ""circumstances"" as well as ""classes"" have to be prescribed in order to comply with the requirement of sub-clause (a) of article 22 (7). The sub-clause (a) of the article lays down a purely enabling provision and Parliament, if it so chooses, may pass any legislation in terms of the same. Where an optional power is conferred on certain authority to perform two separate acts, ordinarily it would not be obligatory upon it to perform both; it may do either if it so likes. Here the classes have been specified and the classes apparently are composed of persons who are detained for the purpose of preventing them from committing certain apprehended acts. I am extremely doubtful whether the classes themselves could be described as ""circumstances"" as they purport to have been done in the section. ""Circumstances"" would ordinarily refer to conditions like war, rebellion, communal disturbances and things like that, under which extra precaution might be :necessary and the detention of suspected persons beyond the period of three months without the sanction of the advisory board might be justified. It is said that the likelihood of these persons committing the particular acts which are specified might constitute ""circumstances."" In my opinion, that is not a plain and sensible interpretation. But whatev- er that may be, as I am of opinion that it is not obligatory on Parliament to prescribe both the circumstances and the classes of cases, I am unable to hold that section 12 is ultra vires the Constitution because the circumstances are not mentioned. As I have said at the beginning, the draft is rather clumsy and I do not know why Parliament used the word ""or"" when in the Constitution itself the word ""and"" has been used. In the fourth and last point raised by Mr. Nambiar the principal question for consideration is the validity of section 14 of the Preventive Detention Act. Subsection (1)of section 14 prohibits any Court from allowing any statement to be made or any evidence to be given before it of the substance of any Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 121 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 communication made under section 7 of the grounds on which a detention order has been made against any person or any representation made by him against such order. It further provides that no Court shall be entitled to require any public officer to produce before it or to disclose the substance of any such communication or representation made or the proceedings of an advisory board or that part of the report of an advisory board which is confidential. Sub-section (2) further provides that: ""It shall be an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both, for any person to disclose or publish without the previous authorisation of the Central Government or the State Government, as the' case may be, any contents or matter purporting to be contents of any such communication or representation as is referred to in sub-section (1): Provided that nothing in this sub-section shall apply to a disclosure made to his legal adviser by a person who is the subject of a detention order."" The provisions of this section are obviously of a most drastic character. It imposes a ban on the Court and pre- vents it from allowing any statement to be made or any evidence produced before it of the substance of any communi- cation made to the detenu apprising him of the grounds upon which the detention order was made. The Court is also incompetent to look into the proceedings before the advisory board or the report of the latter which is confidential. Further the disclosure of such materials has been made a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year. Mr. Nambiar's contention is that these restrictions render utterly nugatory the provi- sions of article 32 of the Constitution which guarantees to every person the right to move this Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution. It is not disputed that the petitioner has the right of moving this Court for a writ of habeas corpus, and unless the Court is in a position to look into and examine the grounds upon which the detention order has been made, it is impossible for it to come to any deci- sion on the point and pass a proper judgment. Though the right to move this Court is not formally taken away, the entire proceedings are rendered ineffective and altogether illusory. On behalf of the respondent, it is pointed out that article 32 guarantees only the right to constitutional remedy for enforcement of the rights which are declared by the Constitution. If there are no rights under the Constitution, guaranteed to a person who is detained under any law of preventive deten- tion, no question of enforcing such rights by an ap- proach to this Court at all arises. I do not think that this argument proceeds on a sound basis; and in my opinion, section 14 does take away and materially curtails some of the fundamental rights which are guaranteed by the Constitu- tion itself. Article 22, clause (5), of the Constitution lays down as a fundamental right that when a person is detained for preventive detention, the authority making the order shall, as soon as may be, communicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made, and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representa- tion against the order. Under clause (6), the authority need not disclose such facts as it considers to be against public interest to disclose. But so far as the grounds are concerned, the disclosure is not prohibited under any cir- cumstance. It is also incumbent upon the detaining authori- ty to afford a detenu the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the detention order. It has been held in several cases, and in my opinion quite rightly, that if the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 122 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 grounds supplied to a detained person are of such a vague and indefinite character that no proper and adequate representation could be made in reply to the same, that itself would be an infraction of the right which has been given to the detenu under law. In my opinion, it would not be possible for the Court to decide whether the provisions of article 22, clause (5), have been duly complied with and the fundamental right guaranteed by it has been made avail- able to the detenu unless the grounds communicated to him under the provisions of this article are actually produced before the Court. Apart from this, it is also open to. the person detained to contend that the detention order has been a main fide exercise of power by the detain- ing authority and that the grounds upon which it is based, are not proper or relevant grounds which would justify detention under the-provisions of the law itself. These rights of the detenu would for all practical purposes be rendered unenforceable if the Court is precluded from look- ing into the grounds which have been supplied to him under section 7 of the Preventive Detention Act. In my opinion, section 14 of the Preventive Detention Act does materially affect the fundamental rights declared under Part III of the Constitution and for this reason it must be held to be illegal and ultra vires. It is not disputed, however, that this section can be severed from the rest of the Act without affecting the other provisions of the Act in any way. The whole Act cannot, therefore, be held to be ultra vires. Mr. Nambiar has further argued that section 3 of the Act also contravenes the provisions of article 32 of the Consti- tution, for it makes satisfaction of the particular authori- ties final in matters of preventive detention and thereby prevents this Court from satisfying itself as to the propriety of the detention order. This contention cannot succeed as no infraction of any fundamental right is in- volved in it. As has been pointed out already, this Court cannot interfere unless it is proved that the power has been exercised by the authorities in a mala fide manner or that the grounds are not proper or relevant grounds which justify detention. The provisions are undoubtedly harsh, but as they do not take away the rights under articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution, they cannot be held to be illegal or ultra vires. The result, therefore, is that, in my opinion, the Preventive Detention Act must be declared to be intra vires the Constitution with the exception of section 14 which is held to be illegal and ultra vires. The present petition, however, must stand dismissed, though it may be open to the petitioner to make a fresh application if he so chooses and if the grounds that have been supplied to him under section 7 of the Act do furnish adequate reasons for making such application. DAS J.--I am likewise of opinion that this application should be dismissed. The contention of learned counsel appearing in support of this application is that the provisions of the Preventive Detention Act, 1950 (Act IV of 1950), are extremely drastic and wholly unreasonable and take away or, in any event, considerably abridge the fundamental rights conferred on the citizens by the provisions of Part III of the Constitution and that this Court should declare the Act wholly void under article 13 (2) of the Constitution and set the petitioner at liberty. It is necessary to bear in mind the scope and ambit of the powers of the Court under the Constitution. The powers of the Court are not the same under all Constitutions. In England Parliament is supreme and there is no limitation upon its legislative powers. Therefore, a law duly made by Parliament cannot be challenged in any Court. The English Courts have to interpret and apply the law; they have no authority to declare such a law illegal or unconstitutional. By the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 123 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 American Constitution the' legislative power of the Union is vested in the Congress and in a sense the Congress is the supreme legislative power. But the written Constitu- tion of the United States is supreme above all the three limbs of Government and, therefore, the law made by the Congress, in order to be valid, must be in conformity with the provisions of the Constitution. If it is not, the Supreme Court will intervene and declare that law to be unconstitutional and void. As will be seen more fully hereafter, the Supreme Court of the United States, under the leadership of Chief Justice Marshall, assumed the power to. declare any law unconstitutional on the ground of its not being in ""due process of law,"" an expression to be found in the Fifth Amendment (1791) of the United States Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) which related to the State Constitutions. It is thus that the Supreme Court established its own supremacy over the executive and the Congress. In India the position of the Judiciary is some- where in between the Courts in England and the United States. While in the main leaving our Parliament and the State Legisla- tures supreme in their respective legislative fields, our Constitution has, by some of the articles, put upon the Legislatures certain specified limitations some of which will have to be discussed hereafter. The point to be noted, however, is that in so far as there is any limitation on the legislative power, the Court must, on a complaint being made to it, scrutinise and ascertain whether such limitation has been transgressed and if there has been any transgression the Court will courageously declare the law unconstitution- al, for the Court is bound by its oath to uphold the Consti- tution. But outside the limitations imposed on the legisla- tive powers our Parliament and the State Legislatures are supreme in their respective legislative fields and the Court has no authority to question the wisdom or policy of the law duly made by the appropriate legislature. Our Constitution, unlike the English Constitution, recognises the Court's supremacy over the legislative authority, but such supremacy is a very limited one, for it is confined to the field where the legislative power is circumscribed by limitations put upon it by the Constitution itself. Within this restrict- ed field the Court may, on a scrutiny of the law made by the Legislature, declare it void if it is found to have trans- gressed the constitutional limitations. But our Constitu- tion, unlike the American Constitution, does not recognise the absolute supremacy of the Court over the legislative authority in all respects, for outside the restricted field of constitutional limitations our Parliament and the State Legislatures are supreme in their respective legislative fields and in that wider field there is no scope for the Court in India to play the role of the Supreme Court of the United States. It is well for us to constantly remember this basic limitation on our own powers. The impugned Act has been passed by Parliament after the Constitution came into force. Article 246 gives exclusive power to Parliament to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule and it gives exclusive power to the State Legislatures to make laws with respect to any of the matters specified in List II of that Schedule. It also gives concurrent power to Parliament as well as to the State Legislatures to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh Schedule. Residuary powers of legislation are vested in parliament under article 248. The first thing to note is that under Entry 9 of List I the parliament and under Entry 3 in List III both parliament and the State Legislatures are empowered to make laws for preventive detention for reasons connected with the several matters specified in the respective entries. This legisla- tion is not conditioned upon the existence of any war with a foreign power or upon the proclamation of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 124 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 emergency under Part XVIII of the Constitution. Our Constitution has, there- fore, accepted preventive detention as the subjectmatter of peacetime legislation as distinct from emergency legisla- tion. It is a novel feature to provide for preventive detention in the Constitution. There is no such provision in the Constitution of any other country that I know of. Be that as it may, for reasons good or bad, our Constitution has deliberately and plainly given power to Parliament and the State Legislatures to enact preventive detention laws even in peacetime. To many of us a preventive detention law is odious at all times but what I desire to emphasise is that it is not for the Court to question the wisdom and policy of the Constitution which the people have given unto themselves. This is another basic fact which the Court must not overlook. The next thing to bear in mind is that, if there were nothing else in the Constitution, the legislative powers of Parliament and the State Legislatures in their respective fields would have been absolute. In such circumstances the Court would have been entitled only to scrutinise whether Parliament or the State Legislature had, in making a partic- ular law, over-. stepped its legislative field and en- croached upon the legislative field of the other legislative power, but could not have otherwise questioned the validity of any law made by the parliament or the State Legislatures. Thus under Entry 9 of List I the Parliament and under Entry 3 of List III the Parliament and the State Legislature could make as drastic a preventive detention law as it pleased. Such a law might have authorised a policeman, not to speak of a District Magistrate or Sub-Divisional Magistrate or the Commissioner of Police, to take a man, citizen or non-citi- zen, into custody and keep him in detention for as long as he pleased. This law might not have made any provision for supplying to the detenu the grounds of his detention or affording any opportunity to him to make any representation to anybody or for setting up any advisory board at all. Likewise, under Entries 1 and 2 in List III the Parliament or the State Legislature might have added as many new and novel offences as its fancy might have dictated and provided for any cruel penalty ranging from the maiming of the limbs to boiling to death in oil or repealed the whole of the Code of Criminal Procedure and provided for trial by battle or ordeal or for conviction by the verdict of a sorcerer or a soothsayer. Such law might have forbidden any speech criti- cising the Government, however mildly, or banned all public meetings or prohibited formation of all associations under penalty of law. Under Entry 33 of List I the Parliament might have made a law for acquiring anybody's properties for the purposes of the Union without any compensation and under Entry 36 in List III the State Legislature could do the same subject to the provisions of Entry 42 in List III which empowers the making of a law laying down principles for payment of compensation which might be anything above noth- ing. Under Entry 81 Parliament could have made any law restricting or even prohibiting inter-State migration so that a Bengali would not be able to move into and settle in Bihar or vice versa. It is needless to multiply instances of atrocious laws which Parliament or the State Legislature might have made under article 246 read with the different lists if there were nothing else in the Constitution. Our Legislatures, subject to the limitation of distribution of legislative powers, would have been as supreme in their respective legislative fields as the English Parliament is and has been. The Court in India, in such event, would have had to take the law duly made, inter- pret it and apply it. It would not have been entitled to utter a word as to the propriety of the particular law, although it might have shuddered at the monstrous atrocities of such law. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 125 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 Our Constitution, however, has not accepted this abso- lute supremacy of our Parliament or the State Legislature. Thus by article 245 (1) the legislative power is definitely made ""subject to the provisions of this Constitution."" Turning to the Constitution, article 13 (2) provides as follows: ""The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void."" This clearly puts a definite limitation on the wide legislative powers given by article 246. It is certainly within the competency of the Court to judge and declare whether there has been any contravention of this limitation. In this respect again the Court has supremacy over the Legislature. From the provisions so far referred to, it clearly follows that there are two principal limitations to the legislative power of parliament, namely,-- (i) that the law must be within the legislative compe- tence of parliament as prescribed by article 246; and (ii) that such law must be subject to the pro-visions of the Constitution and must not take away or abridge the rights conferred by Part III. There can be no question--and, indeed, the learned Attorney-General does not contend otherwise--that both these matters are justiciable and it is open to the Courts to decide whether Parliament has transgressed either of the limitations upon its legislative power. Learned counsel for the petitioner does not say that the impugned Act is ultra vires the legislative powers of Parliament as prescribed by article 246. His contention is that the impugned Act is void because it takes away or abridges the fundamental rights of citizens conferred by Part III of the Constitution. It is, therefore, necessary to ascertain first the exact nature, extent and scope of the particular fundamental right insist- ed upon and then to see whether the impugned Act has taken away or, in any way, abridged the fundamental right so ascertained. Civil rights of a person are generally divided into two classes, namely, the rights attached to the person (jus personarum) and the rights to things, i.e., property (jus rerum). Of the rights attached to the person, the first and foremost is the freedom of life, which means the right to live, i.e., the right that one's life shall not be taken away except under authority of law. Next to the freedom of life comes the freedom of the person, which means that one's body shall not be touched, violated, arrested or imprisoned and one's limbs shall not be injured or maimed except under authority of law. The truth of the matter is that the right to live and the freedom of the person are the primary rights attached to the person. If a man's person is free, it is then and then only that he can exercise a variety of other auxiliary rights, that is to say, he can, within certain limits, speak what he likes, assemble where he likes, form any associations or unions, move about freely as his ""own inclination may direct,"" reside and settle anywhere he likes and practise any profession or carry on any occupation, trade or business. These are attributes of the freedom of the person and are Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 126 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 consequently rights attached to the person. It should be clearly borne in mind that these are not all the rights attached to the person. Besides them there are varieties of other rights which are also the attributes of the freedom of the person. All rights attached to the person are usually called personal liberties and they are too numerous to be enumerated. Some of these auxiliary rights are so important and fundamental that they are re- garded and valued as separate and independent rights apart from the freedom of the person. Personal liberties may be compendiously summed up as the right to do as one pleases within the law. I say within the law because liberty is not unbridled licence. It is what Edmund Burke called ""regulated freedom."" Said Montesquieu in Book III, Ch. 3, of his Spirit of the Laws: ""In Governments, that is, in societies directed by laws, liberty can consist only in the power of doing what we ought to will, and in not being constrained to do what we ought not to will. We must have continually present to our minds the difference between independence and liberty. Liberty is a right of doing whatever the laws permit, and if a citizen could do what they forbid, he would no longer be possessed of liberty, because all his fellow-citizens would enjoy the same power."" To the same effect are the following observations of Webster in his Works Vol. II, p. 393: ""Liberty is the creation of law, essentially different from that authorised licentiousness that trespasses on right. It is a legal and refined idea, the offspring of high civilization, which the savage never understands, and never can understand. Liberty exists in proportion to wholesome restraint; the more restraint on others to keep off from us, the more liberty we have. It is an error to suppose that liberty consists in a paucity of laws ......... The working of our complex system, full of checks and restraints on legislative, executive and judicial power is favourable to liberty and justice. These checks and restraints are so many safeguards set around individual rights and interests. That man is free who is protected from injury."" Therefore, putting restraint on the freedom of wrong doing of one person is really. securing the liberty of the intended victims. To curb the freedom of the saboteur of surreptitiously removing the fish plates from the railway lines is to ensure the safety and liberty of movement of the numerous innocent and unsuspecting passengers. Therefore, restraints on liberty should be judged not only subjectively as applied to a few individuals who come within their opera- tions but also objectively as securing the liberty of a far greater number of individuals. Social interest in individu- al liberty may well have to be subordinated to other greater social interests. If a law ensures and protects the greater social interests then such law will be a wholesome and beneficent law although it may infringe the liberty of some individuals, for it will enure for the greater liberty of the rest of the members of the society. At the same time, our liberty has also to be guarded against executive, legislative as well as judicial usurpation of powers and prerogatives. Subject to certain restraints on individuals and reasonable checks on the State every person has a varie- ty of personal liberties too numerous to be cataloged. As will be seen more fully hereafter, our Constitution has recognised personal liberties as fundamental rights. It has guaranteed some of them under article 19 (1) but put Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 127 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 re- straints on them by clauses (2) to (6). It has put checks on the State's legislative powers by articles 21 and 22. It has by providing for preventive detention, recognised that individual liberty may be subordinated to the larger social interests. Turning now to the Constitution I find that Part III is headed and deals with ""Fundamental Rights"" under seven heads, besides, ""General"" provisions (articles 12 and 13), namely ""Right to Equality"" (articles 14 to 18), ""Right to Freedom"" (articles 19 to 22), ""Right against Exploitation"" (articles 23 and 24), ""Right to Freedom of Religion"" (articles 25 to 28), ""Cultural and Educational Rights"" (articles 29 and 30), ""Right to Property"" (article 31), ""Right to Constitutional Remedies"" (articles 32 to 35). Under the heading ""Right to Freedom"" are grouped four arti- cles, 19 to 22. Article 19 (1) is in the following terms :-- "" (1) All citizens shall have the right- (a) to freedom of speech and expression; (b) to assemble peaceably and without arms; (c) to form associations or unions; (d) to move freely throughout the territory of India; (e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India; (f) to acquire, hold and dispose of property; and (g) to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business."" It will be noticed that of the seven rights protected by clause (1) of article 19, six of them, namely, (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g) are what are said to be rights at- tached to the person (jus personarum). The remaining item, namely, (f) is the right to property (jus rerum). If there were nothing else in article 19 these rights would have been absolute rights and the protection given to them would have completely debarred parliament or any of the State Legisla- tures from making any law taking away or abridging any of those rights. But a perusal of article 19 makes it abun- dantly clear that none of the seven rights enumerated in clause (1) is an absolute right, for each of these rights is liable to be curtailed by laws made or to be made by the State to the extent mentioned in the several clauses (2) to (6) of that article. Those clauses save the power of the State to make laws imposing certain specified restrictions on the several rights. The nett result is that the unlimit- ed legislative power given by article 246 read with the different legislative lists in the Seventh Schedule is cut down by the provisions of article 19 and all laws made by the State with respect to these rights must, in order Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 128 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 to be valid, observe these limitations. Whether any law has in fact transgressed these limitations is to be ascertained by the Court and if in its view the restrictions imposed by the law are greater than what is permitted by clauses (2) to (6) whichever is applicable the Court will declare the same to be unconstitutional and, therefore, void under article 13. Here again there is scope for the application of the ""intel- lectual yardstick"" of the Court. If, however, the Court finds, on scrutiny, that the law has not overstepped the constitutional limitations, the Court will have to uphold the law, whether it likes the law or not. The first part of the argument is put broadly, namely, that personal liberty is generally guaranteed by the Consti- tution by article 19 (1) and that the Preventive Detention Act, 1950, has imposed unreasonable restrictions thereon in violation of the provisions of clauses (2) to (6) of that article. The very first question that arises, therefore, is as to whether the freedom of the person which is primarily and directly suspended or de- stroyed by preventive detention is at all governed by arti- cle 19 (1). If personal liberty as such is guaranteed by any of the sub-clauses of article 19 (1) then why has it also been protected by article 21 ? The answer suggested by learned counsel for the petitioner is that personal liberty as a substantive right is protected by article 19 (1) and article 21 gives only an additional protection by prescrib- ing the procedure according to which that right may be taken away. I am unable to accept this contention. If this argument were correct, then it would follow that our Consti- tution does not guarantee to any person, citizen or non- citizen, the freedom of his life as a substantive right at all, for the substantive right to life does not fall within any of the sub-clauses of clause (1) of article 19. It is retorted in reply that no constitution or human laws can guarantee life which is the gift of God who alone can guar- antee and protect it. On a parity of reasoning no Constitu- tion or human laws can in that sense guarantee freedom of speech or free movement, for one may be struck dumb by disease or may lose the use of his legs by paralysis or as a result of amputation. Further, what has been called the procedural protection of article 21 would be an act of supererogation, for when God takes away one's life, whatever opportunity He may have had given to Adam to explain his conduct before sending him down, He is not likely in these degenerate-days to observe the requirements of notice or fair trial before any human tribunal said to be required by article 21. The fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment of the American Constitution give specific protection to life as a substantive right. So does article 31 of the Japanese Constitution of 1946. There is no reason why our Constitution should not do the same. The truth is that article 21 has given that protection to life as a substan- tive right and that, as will be seen hereafter, that article properly understood does not purport to prescribe any par- ticular procedure at all. The further astounding result of the argument of counsel for the petitioner will be that the citizen of India will have only the rights enumerated in article 19, clause (1) and no other right attached to his person. As I have already stated, besides the several rights mentioned in the several sub- clauses of article 19 (1) there are many other personal liberties which a free man, i.e., a man who has the freedom of his person, may exercise. Some of those other rights have been referred to by Harries C.J. of Calcutta in his unreported judgment in Miscellaneous Case No. 166 of 1950 (K.shitindra v. The Chief Secretary of West Bengal) while referring the case to a Full Bench in the following words :-- ""It must be remembered that a free man has far more and wider rights than those stated in article 19 (1) of the Constitution. For example, a free man can eat what he likes subject to rationing laws, work as much as he likes or idle as much as he likes. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 129 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 He can drink anything he likes subject to the licensing laws and smoke and do a hundred and one things which are not included in article 19. If freedom of person was the result of article 19, then a free man would only have the seven rights mentioned in that article. But obviously the free man in India has far greater rights."" I find myself in complete agreement with the learned Chief Justice on this point. If it were otherwise, the citizen's right to eat what he likes will be liable to be taken away by the executive fiat of the Civil Supply Depart- ment without the necessity of any rationing laws. The Government may enforce prohibition without any prohibition laws or licensing laws and so on. I cannot accept that our Constitution intended to give no protection to the bundle of rights which, together with the rights mentioned in sub- clauses (a) to (e) and (g) make up personal liberty. In- deed, I regard it as a merit of our Constitution that it does not attempt to enumerate exhaustively all the personal rights but uses the compendious expression ""personal liber- ty"" in' article 21, and protects all of them. It is pointed out that in the original draft the word ""liberty"" only was used as in the American Constitution but the Drafting Committee added the word ""personal"" to make it clear that what was being protected by what is now article 21 was not what had already been pro- tected by what is now article 19. If it were permissible to refer to the Drafting Committee's report, it would be anoth- er answer to the contentions of learned counsel for the petitioner that personal liberty as a substantive right was protected by article 19. I do not, however, desire to base my judgment on the Drafting Committee's report and I express no opinion as to its admissibility. Whatever the intentions of the Drafting Committee might have been, the Constitution as finally passed has in article 21 used the words ""personal liberty"" which have a definite connotation in law as I have explained. It does not mean only liberty of the person but it means liberty or the rights attached to the person (jus personarum). The expressions ""freedom of life"" or ""personal liberty"" are not to be found in article 19 and it is strain- ing the language of article 19 to squeeze in personal liber- ty into that article. In any case the right to life cannot be read into article 19. Article 19 being confined, in its operation, to citizens only, a non-citizen will have no protection for his life and personal liberty except what has been called the procedural protection of article 21. If there be no substantive right what will the procedure protect ? I recognise that it is not imperative that a foreigner should have the same privileges as are given to a citizen, but if article 21 is construed in the way I have suggested even a foreigner will have equal protection for his life and personal liberty before the laws of our country under our Constitution. I am unable, there- fore, for all the reasons given above, to agree that person- al liberties are the result of article 19 or that that article purports to protect all of them. It is next urged that the expression ""personal liberty"" is synonymous with the right to move freely and, therefore, comes directly under article 19 (1) (d). Reference is made to the unreported dissenting judgment of Sen J. of Calcutta in Miscellaneous Case No. 166 of 1950 while referring that case to a Full Bench. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 130 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 In his judgment Sen J. quoted the following passage from Blackstone's Commentaries :-- ""Next to personal security the law of :England regards, asserts and preserves, the personal liberty of individuals. This personal liberty consists in the power of locomotion, of changing situation, or moving one's person to whatsoever place one's own inclination may direct, without imprisonment or restraint, unless by due course of law."" (Page 73 of George Chase's Edition (4th Edition) of Blackstone, Book I, Chapter I. On the authority of the above passage the learned Judge concluded that personal liberty came within article 19 (1)(d). I am unable to agree with the learned Judge's con- clusion. On a perusal of Chapter I of Book I of Black- stone's Commentaries it will appear that the]earned commen- tator divided the rights attached to the person (jus person- arum) into two classes, namely, ""personal security"" and ""personal liberty."" Under the head ""personal security"" Blackstone included several rights, namely, the rights to' life, limb, body, health and reputation, and under the head ""personal liberty"" he placed only the right of free move- ment. He first dealt with the several rights classified by him under the head ""personal security"" and then proceeded to say that next to those rights came personal liberty which according to his classification consisted only in the right of free locomotion. There is no reason to suppose that in article 21 of our Constitution the expression ""personal liberty"" has been used in the restricted sense in which Blackstone used it in his Commentaries. If ""personal liber- ty"" in article 21 were synonymous with the right to move freely which is mentioned in article 19 (1) (d), then the astounding result will be that only the last mentioned right has what has been called the procedural protection of arti- cle 21 but none of the other rights in the other sub-clauses of article 19 (1) has any procedural protection at all. According to learned counsel for the petitioner the proce- dure required by article 21 consists of notice and a right of hearing before an impartial tribunal. Therefore, accord- ing to him, a man's right of movement cannot be taken away without giving him notice and a fair trial before an impartial tribunal but he may be deprived of his freedom of speech or his property or any of his other rights without the formality of any procedure at all. The proposi- tion has only to be stated to be rejected. In my judgment, article '19 protects some of the important attributes of personal liberty as independent rights and the expression ""personal liberty"" has been 'used in article 21 as a compen- dious term including within its meaning all the varieties of rights which go to make up the personal liberties of men. Learned counsel for the petitioner next contends that personal liberty undoubtedly means or includes the freedom of the person and the pith and substance of the freedom of the person is right to move about freely and consequently a preventive detention law which destroys or suspends the freedom of the person must inevitably destroy or suspend the right of free movement and must necessarily offend against the protection given to the citizen by article 19 (1)(d) unless it satisfies the test of reasonableness laid down in clause (5). Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 131 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 The argument is attractive and requires serious consideration as to the exact purpose and scope of sub- clause (d) of article 19 (1). There are indications in the very language of article 19 (1) (d) itself that its purpose is to protect not the gener- al right of free movement which emanates from the freedom of the person but only a specific and 'limited aspect of it, namely, the special right of a free citizen of India to move freely throughout the Indian territory, i.e., from one State to another within the Union. In other words, it guarantees, for example, that a free Indian citizen ordinarily residing in the State of West Bengal will be free to move from West Bengal to Bihar or to reside and settle in Madras or the Punjab without any let or hindrance other than as provided in clause (5). It is this special right of movement of the Indian citizen in this specific sense and for this particu- lar purpose which is protected by article 19 (1) (d). It is argued on the authority of a decision of a Special Bench of the Calcutta High Court presided over by Sen J. in Sunil Kumar v. The Chief Secretary of West Bengal (1) that the words ""through-. out the territory of India"" occurring in that sub-clause only indicate that our Constitution does not guarantee to its citizens the right of free movement in or into foreign territory and that those words have been added to save passport restrictions. I am unable to accept this interpre- tation. Our Constitution cannot possibly give to any of its citizens any right of free movement in a foreign country and it was wholly superfluous to specifically indicate this in the Constitution, for that would have gone without saying. The words ""throughout the territory of India"" are not used in connection with most of the other sub-clauses of clause (1) of article 19. Does such omission indicate that our Constitution guarantees to its citizens freedom of speech and expression, say, in Pakistan ? Does it guarantee to. its citizens a right to assemble or to form associations or unions in a foreign territory ? Clearly not. Therefore, it was not necessary to use those words in sub-clause (d) to indicate that free movement in foreign countries was not being guaranteed. It is said that by the use of those words the Constitution makes it clear that no1 guarantee was being given to any citizen with regard to emigration from India without a passport and that the freedom of movement was restricted within the territory of India. Does the omission of those words from article 19 (1) (a) indicate that the citizen of India has been guaranteed such freedom of speech and expression as will enable him to set up a broadcasting station and broadcast his views and expressions to foreign lands without a licences ? Clearly not. Dropping this line of argument and adopting a totally new line of argument it is said that by the use of the words ""throughout the territory of India"" the Constitution indicates that the widest right of free movement that it could possibly give to its citizens has been given. Does. then, the omission of those words from the other subclauses indicate that the Constitution has kept back some parts of those rights even beyond the limits of the qualifying clauses that follow ? Do not those other rights prevail throughout the Indian territory ? (1) 54 C.W.N. 394. Clearly they do, even without those words. Therefore, those words must have been used in sub-clause (d) for -some other purpose. That other purpose, as far as I can apprehend it, is to indicate that free movement from one State to another within the Union is protected so that Parliament may not by a law made under Entry 81 in List I curtail it beyond the limits prescribed by Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 132 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 clause (5) of article 19. Its purpose, as I read it, is not to provide protection for the general right of free movement but to secure a specific and special right of the Indian citizen to move freely throughout the territories of India regarded as an independent additional right apart from the general right of locomotion emanating from the freedom of the person. It is a guarantee against unfair discrimination in the matter of free movement of the Indian citizen throughout the Indian Union. In short, it is a protection against provincialism. It has nothing to do with the freedom of the person as such. That is guaranteed to every person, citizen or otherwise, in the manner and to the extent formulated by article 21. Clause (5) of article 19 qualifies sub-clause (d) of clause (1) which should, therefore, be read in the light of clause (5). The last mentioned clause permits the State to impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right of free movement throughout the territory of India as ex- plained above. Imposition of reasonable restrictions clearly implies that the right of free movement is not entirely destroyed but that parts of the right remain. This reasona- ble restriction can be imposed either in the interest of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe. The Scheduled Tribes usually reside in what are called the Scheduled Areas. The provision for imposing restriction on the citizens' right of free movement in the interests of the Scheduled Tribes clearly indicates that the restriction is really on his right of free movement into or within the Scheduled Areas. It means that if it be found necessary for the protection of the Scheduled Tribes the citizens may be restrained from entering into or moving about in the Scheduled Areas, although they are left quite free to move about elsewhere. This restraint may well be necessary for the protection of the members of the, Sched- uled Tribes who are generally impecunious and constitute a backward class. They may need protection against money- lenders or others who may be out to exploit them. They may have to be protected against their own impecunious habits which may result in their selling or mortgaging their hearths and homes. Likewise, the free movement of citizens may have to be restricted in the interest of the general public. A person suffering from an infectious disease may be prevent from moving about and spreading the disease. and regulations for his segregation in the nature of quarantine may have to be introduced. Likewise, healthy people may be prevented, in the interests of the general public, from entering a plague-infected area. There may be protected places, e.g., forts or other strategic places, access where- to may have to be regulated or even prohibited in the inter- ests of the general public. The point to be noted, however, is that when free movement is thus restricted, whether in the interest of the general public or for the protection of the Scheduled Tribes, such restriction has reference gener- ally to a certain local area which becomes the prohibited area but the right of free movement in all other areas in the Union is left unimpaired. The circumstance that clause (5) contemplates only the taking away of a specified area and thereby restricting the field of the exercise of the right conferred by subclause (d) of clause (1) indicates to my mind that subclause (d)is concerned, not with the freedom of the person or the general right of free movement but with a specific aspect of it regarded as an independent right apart from the freedom of the person. In other words in sub-clause (d)the real emphasis is on the words ""throughout the territory of India."" The purpose of article 19 (1) (d) is to guarantee that there shall be no State barrier. It gives protection against provincialism. It has nothing to do with the freedom of the person as such. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 133 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 Finally, the ambit and scope of the rights protected by article 19 (1) have to be considered. Does it protect the right of free movement and the other personal rights therein mentioned in all circumstances irrespective of any other consideration ? Does it not postulate a capacity to exercise the rights ? Does its protection continue even though the citizen lawfully loses his capacity for exercising those rights ? How can the continuance of those personal rights be compatible with the lawful detention of the person ? These personal rights and lawful detention cannot go together. Take the case of a person who has been properly convicted of an offence punish- able under a section of the Indian Penal Code as to the reasonableness of which there is no dispute. His right to freedom of speech is certainly impaired. Under clause (2) the State may make a law relating to libel, slander, defama- tion, contempt of Court or any matter which offends against decency or morality or which undermines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State. Any law on any of these matters contemplated by this clause certainly must have some direct reference to speech and expression. It means that the law may directly curtail the freedom of speech so that the citizen may not talk libel or speak contemptuously of the Court or express indecent or immoral sentiments by speech or other forms of expression or utter seditious words. To say that every crime undermines the security of the State and, therefore, every section of the Indian Penal Code, irrespective of whether it has any reference to speech or expression, is a law within the meaning of this clause is wholly unconvincing and betrays only a vain and forlorn attempt to find an explanation for meeting the argument that any conviction by a Court of law must necessarily infringe article 19 (1) (a). -There can be no getting away from the fact that a detention as a result of a conviction impairs the freedom of speech far beyond what is permissible under clause (2) of article 19. Likewise a detention on lawful conviction impairs each of the other personal rights men- tioned in sub-clauses (b) to (e) and (g) far beyond the limits of clauses (8) to (6). The argument that every section of the Indian Penal Code irrespective of whether it has any reference to any of the rights referred to in sub- clauses (b) to (e) and (g) is a law imposing reasonable restriction on those several rights has not even the merit of plausibility. There can be no doubt that a detention as a result of lawful conviction must necessari- ly impair the fundamental personal rights guaranteed by article 19 (1) far beyond what is permissible under clauses (2) to (6) of that article and yet nobody can think of questioning the validity of the detention or of the section of the Indian Penal Code under which the sentence was passed. Why ? Because the freedom of his person having been lawfully taken away, the convict ceases to be entitled to exercise the freedom of speech and expression or any of the other personal rights protected by clause (1) of article 19. On a parity of reasoning he cannot, while the detention lasts, exercise any other personal right, e.g., he cannot eat what he likes or when he likes but has to eat what the Jail Code provides for him and at the time when he is by Jail regulations required to eat. Therefore, the conclusion is irresistible that the rights protected by article 19 (1), in so far as they relate to rights attached to the person, i.e., the rights referred to in sub-clauses (a) to (e) and (g), are rights which only a free citizen, who has the freedom of his person unimpaired, can exercise. It is pointed out, as a counter to the above reasonings, that detention as a result of a lawful conviction does not deprive a person of his right to acquire or hold or dispose of his property mentioned in sub-clause (f). The answer is simple, namely, that that right is not a right attached to the person (jus personrum) and its existence is not depend- ent on the freedom of the person. Loss Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 134 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 of freedom of the person, therefore, does not suspend the right to property. But suppose a person loses his property by reason of its having been compulsorily acquired under article 31 he loses his right to hold that property and cannot complain that his fundamental right under sub-clause (f) of clause (1) of article 19 has been infringed. It follows that the rights enumerated in article 19 (1) subsist while the citizen has the legal capacity to exercise them. If his capacity to exercise them is gone, by reason of a lawful conviction with respect to the rights in sub-clauses (a) to (e) and (g), or by reason of a lawful compulsory acquisition with respect to the right in sub- clause (f), he ceases to have those rights while his inca- pacity lasts. It further follows that if a citizen's free- dom of the person is lawfully taken away otherwise than as a result of a lawful conviction for an offence, that citizen, for precisely the same reason, cannot exercise any of the rights attached to his person including those enumerated in sub-clauses (a) to (e) and (g) of article 19 (1). In my judgment a lawful detention, whether punitive or preventive, does not offend against the protection conferred by article 19 (1) (a) to (e) and (g), for those rights must necessarily cease when the freedom of the person is lawfully taken away. In short, those rights end where the lawful detention be- gins. So construed, article 19 and article 21 may, there- fore, easily go together and there is, in reality, no con- flict between them. It follows, therefore, that the validi- ty or otherwise of preventive detention does not depend on, and is not dealt with by, article 19. To summarise, the freedom of the person is not the result of article 19. Article 19 only deals with' certain particu- lar rights which, in their origin and inception, are attributes of the freedom of the person but being of great importance are regarded as specific and independent rights. It does not deal with the freedom of the person as such. Article 19 (1) (d) protects a specific aspect of the right of free locomotion, namely, the right to move freely throughout the territory of India which is regarded as a special privilege or right of an Indian citizen and is protected as such. The protection of article 19 is co-termi- nous with the legal capacity of a citizen to exercise the rights protected thereby, for sub-clauses (a) to (e) and (g) of article 19 (1) postulate the freedom of the person which alone can ensure the capacity to exercise the rights pro- tected by those sub-clauses. A citizen who loses the free- dom of his person by being lawfully detained, whether as a result of a conviction for an offence or as a result of preventive detention loses his capacity to exercise those rights and, therefore, has none of the rights which sub- clauses (a) to (e) and (g) may protect. In my judgment article 19 has no bearing on the question of the validity or otherwise of preventive detention and, that being so, clause (5) which prescribes a test of reasonable- ness to be defined and applied by the Court has no applica- tion at all. Article 19 being thus out of the way, I come to article 20 which is concerned with providing protection against what are well known as ex post facto laws, double jeopardy and self-incrimination. This article constitutes a limitation on the absolute legislative power which would, but for this article, be exercisable by Parliament or the State Legisla- tures under article 246 read with the legislative lists. If the Legislature disobeys this limitation the Court will certainly prevent it. Article 20 has no bearing on preven- tive detention laws and I pass on. Article 21 runs thus: Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 135 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 ""21. No person shall be deprived of his life or person- al liberty except according to procedure established by law."" The contention of learned counsel for the petitioner is that by this article the Constitution offers to every per- son, citizen or non-citizen, only a procedural protection. According to the argument, this article does not purport to give any protection to life or personal liberty as a sub- stantive right but only prescribes a procedure that must be followed before a person may be deprived of his life or personal liberty. I am unable to accept this contention. Article 21, as the marginal note states, guarantees to every person ""protection of life and personal liberty."" As I read it, it defines the substantive fundamental right to which protection is given and does not purport to prescribe any particular procedure at all. That a person shall not be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law is the substantive fundamental right to which protection is given by the Constitution. The avowed object of the article, as I apprehend it, is to define the ambit of the right to life and personal liberty which is to be protected as a fundamental right. The right to life and personal liberty protected by article 21 is not an absolute right but is a qualified right--a right circumscribed by the possibility or risk of being lost according to procedure established by law. Liability to deprivation according to procedure established by law is in the nature of words of limitation. The article delimits the right by a reference to its liability to deprivation according to procedure estab- lished by law and by this very definition throws a corre- sponding obligation on the State to follow a procedure before depriving a man of his life and personal liberty. What that procedure is to be is not within the purpose or purview of this article to prescribe or indicate. The claim of learned counsel for the petitioner is that article 21 prescribes a procedure. This procedure, accord- ing to learned counsel, means those fundamental immutable rules of procedure which are sanctioned or well established by principles of natural justice accepted in all climes and countries and at all times. Apart from the question whether any rule of natural procedure exists which conforms to the notions of justice and fair play of all mankind at all times, it has to be ascertained whether the language of article 21 will permit its introduction into our Constitu- tion. The question then arises as to what is the meaning of the expression ""procedure established by law."" The word ""procedure"" in article 21 must be taken to signify some step or method or manner of proceeding leading up to the depriva- tion of life or personal liberty. According to the language used in the article, this procedure has to be ""established by law."" The word ""establish"" according to the Oxford English Dictionary, Vol. III, p. 297, means, amongst other things, ""to render stable or firm ; to strengthen by materi- al support; to fix, settle, institute or ordain permanently by enactment or agreement."" According to Dr. Annandale's edition of the New Gresham Dictionary the word ""establish,"" means, amongst other things, ""to found permanently; to institute; to enact or decree; to ordain; to ratify; to make firm."" It follows that the word ""established"" in its ordi- nary natural sense means, amongst other things, ""enacted."" ""Established by law"" will, therefore, mean ""enacted by law."" If this sense of the word ""established"" is accepted, then the word ""law"" must mean State-made law and cannot Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 136 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 possibly mean. the principles of natural justice, for no procedure can be said to have ever been ""enacted"" by those principles. When section 124-A of the Indian Penal Code speaks of ""Government established by law,"" surely it does not mean ""Government set up by natural justice."" Therefore, procedure established by law must, I apprehend, be procedure enacted by the State which, by its definition in article 12, includes parliament. There is no escape from this position if the cardinal rule of construc- tion, namely, to give the words used in a statute their ordinary natural meaning, is applied. And this construction introduces no novelty or innovation, for at the date of the Constitution the law of procedure in this country. both civil and criminal, was mainly if not wholly, the creature of statute. The Hindu or Muhammadan laws of procedure were abrogated and replaced by the Code of Civil Procedure or the Code of Criminal Procedure. Therefore, procedure established by law is quite compatible with procedure enact- ed by law. If, however, the word ""established"" is taken to mean ""sanctioned"" or ""settled"" or ""made firm"" then the question will arise as to the meaning of the word ""law"" in that context. Reference is made to Salmond's Jurisprudence, 10th Edition, p. 37, showing that the term ""law"" is used in two senses and it is suggested that the word ""law"" in the expression ""established by law ""means law in its abstract sense of the principles of natural justice. It is ""jus"" and not ""lex,"" says learned counsel for the petitioner. It is pointed out that both the English and the Indian law in many cases, some of which have been cited before us, have recog- nised and applied the principles of natural justice and that this Court should do the same in interpreting tim provisions of our Constitution. I find it difficult to let in princi- ples of natural justice as being within the meaning of the word ""law,"" having regard to the obvious meaning of that word in the other articles. Article 14 certainly embodies a principle of natural justice which ensures to. every person equality before the law. When natural jus- tice speaks of and enjoins equality- before the law, that law must refer to something outside natural justice, and must mean the State-made laws. It is only when the State law gives equality to every person that that law is said to be in accordance with natural justice. There can be no doubt that the words ""in accordance with law"" in article 17 have reference to State law. Likewise, the word ""law"" in article 20 (1) can mean nothing but law made by the State. The same remark applies to the words ""in accordance with law"" in articles 23, 31 and 32. Natural justice does not impose any tax and, therefore, the word ""law"" in articles 265 and 286 must mean State-made law. If this be the correct meaning of the word ""law"" then there is no scope for intro- ducing the principles of natural justice in article 21 and ""procedure established by law"" must mcan procedure estab- lished by law made by the State which, as defined, includes Parliament and the Legislatures of the States. We have been referred to a number of text books and decisions showing the development of the American doctrine of ""due process of law"" and we have been urged to adopt those principles in our Constitution. The matter has to be considered against its historical background. The English settlers in different parts of America had carried with them the English common law as a sort of personal law regulating their rights and liberties inter se as well as between them and the State. After the War Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 137 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 of Independence the Constitu- tions of the United States were drawn up in writing. The majority of those who framed the Constitution were lawyers and had closely studied the Commentaries of the great Eng- lish jurist Blackstone, who in his famous commentaries had advocated the separation of the three limbs of the State, namely, the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. Montesquit's Spirit of Laws had already been published wherein he gave a broader and more emphatic expression to the Aristotelian doctrine of separation of powers. The experience of the repressive laws of Parliament had im- pressed upon the framers of the American Constitution the belief that it was the habit of all legislative bodies to grasp and exercise powers that did not belong to them. The interference of the colonial governors with legislation and the judiciary was also real. This sad experience coupled with the political philosophy of the time induced the fram- ers of the American Constitutions to adopt safeguards not only against the executive but also against the legislature. (See Munro on the Government of the United States, 5th Edition, Chapter IV, p. 53 et seq.). Says Judge Cooley in his Constitutional Limitations, 6th Edition, Vol. II, Chap- ter XI, p. 755: ""The people of the American States, holding the sover- eignty in their own hands, have no occasion to exact any pledges from any one for a due observation of individual rights; but the aggressive tendency of power is such that they have deemed it of no small importance, that, in framing the instruments under which their governments are to be administered by their agents, they should repeat and re- enact this guarantee, and thereby adopt it as a principle of constitutional protection."" There can be little doubt that the people of the differ- ent States in America intended not to take any risk as to their life, liberty or property even from the legislature. As Munro puts it at pp. 58-61 :-- ""The framers of the Constitution set boundaries to the powers of the Congress, and it was their intent that these limitations should be observed. But how was such observance to be enforced by the Courts ? The statesmen of 1767 did not categorically answer that question."" The Constitution was silent and there was no express provision as to who was to serve as umpire in case the Congress overstepped the limits of its legislative powers. By the 5th Amendment what is now known as the ""due process clause"" was introduced in the Federal Constitution and by the 14th Amendment a similar clause was adopted in the State Constitutions. Some of the State Constitutions used the words ""due course of law,"" some repeated the words of Magna Charta, namely, ""the law of the land"" but most of them used the expression ""due process of law."" All the expressions meant the same thing, namely, that no person should be deprived of his life, liberty or property except in due process of law. The Constitution by this clause gave the Supreme Court an opportunity to take upon itself the function of declaring the national laws unconstitutional. And the Supreme Court, under the leadership of Chief Justice John Marshall, seized this opportunity and assumed the right to say the last word on questions of constitutionality, and possesses that right to-day: (Munro, p. 62). The expression ""due process of law"" has been interpreted by the American Courts in different ways at Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 138 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 different times. Carl Brent Swisher in his book on the Growth of Constitutional Power in the United States at p. 107 says, with reference to the development of the doctrine of due procedure: ""The American history of its interpretation falls into three periods. During the first period covering roughly the first century of Government under the Constitution ""due process"" was interpreted ""principally as a restriction upon procedure--and largely the judicial procedure--by which the Government exercised its powers. During the second period,which, again roughly speaking, extended through 1936, ""due process"" was expanded to serve as a restriction not merely upon procedure but upon the substance of the activi- ties in which the Government might engage. During the third period extending from 1936 to date, the use of ""due process"" as a substantive restriction has been largely suspended or abandoned, leaving it principally in its original status as a restriction upon procedure."" In the guise of interpreting ""due process of law"" the American Courts went much further than even Lord Coke ever thought of doing. The American Courts gradually arrogated to themselves the power to revise all legislations. In the beginning they confined themselves to insisting on a due procedure to be followed before a person was deprived of his life, liberty or property. In course of time, ""due process of law"" came to be applied to personal liberty, to social control, to procedure to jurisdiction and to substantive law: (Willis, p. 642). In the words of Munro ""due process of law"" became a sort of palladium covering all manner of individual rights. A_II the while the Supreme Court refused to define the phrase, but used it to enable it to declare unconstitutional any Act of legislation which it thought unreasonable: (Willis, p. 657). In Holden v. Hardy (1) we find the following observa- tions: ""This Court has never attempted to define with precision the words' due process of law ................ It is suffi- cient to say that there are certain immutable principles of justice which inhere in the very idea of free government which no member of the Union may disregard.""In Taylor v. Peter (2) Bronson J. observed: ""The words 'by the law of the land' as used in the Constitution, do not mean a statute passed for the purpose of working the wrong. That construction would render the restriction absolutely nugatory, and turn this part of the Constitution into mere nonsense. The people would be made to say to the two Houses: ' You shall be vested with the legis- lative power of the. State, but no one shall be disenfran- chised or deprived of any of the rights or privileges of a citizen, unless you pass a statute for that purpose. In other words you shall not do the wrong unless you choose to do it.'"" It was thus that the Supreme Court of the United States firmly established its own supremacy over the other two limbs of the State, namely, the executive and the Congress. In the words of John Dickinson quoted in Munro at p. 61, ""The Judges of Aragon began by setting aside laws and ended by making them."" And all this sweeping development could only be possible because of the presence Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 139 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 of one little word ""due"" which, in its content, knows no bound and is not subject to any fixed definition. Whenever a substantive law or some procedure laid down in any law did not find favour with the majority of the learned Judges of the Supreme Court it was not reasonableand, therefore, it was not ""due."" (1) 169 U.S. 366 at p. 389. (2) 4 Hill 140, 145. The very large and nebulous import of the word ""due"" was bound to result in anomalies, for what was not ""due"" on one day according to the Judges then constituting the Supreme Court became ""due"" say 20 years later according to the new Judges who then came to occupy the Bench, for the Court had to adapt the Constitution to the needs of the society which were continually changing and growing. The larger content of due process of law, which included both procedural and substantive due process of law, had of necessity to be narrowed down, for social interest in personal liberty had to give way to social interest in other matters which came to be considered to be of more vital interest to the commu- nity. This was achieved by the Supreme Court of the United States evolving the new doctrine of police powers--a pecul- iarly American doctrine. The police powers are nowhere exhaustively defined. In Chicago B. & Q. Ry. v. Drainage Commissioner (1) ,, police power"" has been stated to ""em- brace regulations designed to promote the public convenience or the general prosperity, as well as regulations designed to promote the public health, the public morals or the public safety."" Reference in this connection may be made to Cooley's Constitutional Limitations, 8th Edition, Vol. II, p. 1223 and to Chapter XXVI of Willis at p. 727. The nett result is that the all-inclusive and indefina- ble doctrine of due process of law has in America now been brought back to its original status of a procedural due process of law by the enunciation and application of the new doctrine of police power as an antidote or palliative to the former. Who knows when the pendulum will swing again. Turning now to what has been called the procedural due process of law it will be found that the matter has been described in different languages in different cases. In Westervelt v. Gregg (2) Edwards J. defined it thus: ""Due process of law undoubtedly means, in the due course of legal proceedings, according to those rules 204 u.s. 561,592. (2) 12 N.Y. 202. and forms which have been established for the protection of private rights."" A more specific definition of the expression ""the law of the land"" meaning procedural due process was given by Web- ster appearing as counsel for the plaintiff in error in the Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward (1): ""By the law of the land is most clearly intended the general law; a law which hears before it condemns; which proceeds upon inquiry and renders judgment only after trial. The meaning is that every citizen shall hold his life, liberty, property, and. immunities, under the protection of the general rules which govern society. Everything which may pass under the form of an enactment is not therefore to be considered the law of the land."" Willis in Ch. XXIII, p. 661, says: Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 140 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 ""The guarantee of due process of law as a matter of procedure means that no part of a person's personal liberty, including ownership, shall be taken away from him except by the observance of certain formalities. Hence its object is the protection of the social interest in personal liberty."" At p. 662 Willis enumerates the requirements of the procedural due process of law as follows:(1) notice. (2) opportunity to be heard, (3) an impartial tribunal, and (4) an orderly course of procedure. In short, the procedural due process requires that a person who is to be deprived of his life, liberty or property shall have had ""his day in Court."" This according to Willough by p. 736, means: ""(1) that he shall have had due notice, which may be actual or constructive, of the institution of the proceed- ings by which his legal rights may be affected; (2) that he shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appear and defend his rights, including the right himself to testify, to produce witnesses, and to introduce relevant documents and other evidence, (3) that the tribunal in or before which his rights are adjudicated is so constituted as to give reasona- ble assurance of its. (1) 4 Wheaton 518 at p. 579; 4 L. Edn. 629 at p. 645. honesty and impartiality; and (4) that it is a Court of competent jurisdiction."" It will be noticed that the fourth item of Willoughby is different from the fourth item of Willis. Such, in short, are the history of the development of the doctrine of the process of law in the United States and the requirements of the procedural due process as insisted on by the Supreme Court of that country. Learned counsel for the petitioner before us does not contend that we should import this American doctrine of due process of law in its full glory but that we should adopt the procedural part of it and insist that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except by the observance of the formalities which justice and fair play require to be observed. The arguments of learned counsel for the petitioner are attractive and in the first blush certainly appeal to our sentiment but on serious reflection I find several insuperable objections to the introduction of the American doctrine of procedural due process of law into our Constitution. That doctrine can only thrive and work where the legislature is subordinate to the judiciary in the sense that the latter can sit in judgment over and review all acts of the legislature. Such a doctrine can have no application to a field where the legislature is supreme. That is why the doctrine of ""due process of law"" is quite different in England where Parliament is supreme. This difference is pointedly described by Mathews J. in Joseph Hurtado v. People of California (1) at p. 531: ""The concessions of Magna Charta were wrung from the King as guarantees against oppression and usurpation of his prerogatives. It did not enter into the minds of the barons to provide security against their own body or in favour of the commons by Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 141 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 limiting the power of Parliament, so that bills of attainder, ex post facto laws, laws declaring forfeitures of estates and other arbitrary Acts of legisla- tion which occur so frequently in English history, were never regarded as inconsistent with the law of the land, for, notwithstanding what was attributed to Lord Coke in. Bonham's (1) (1883) 110 U.S. 516. case, [8 Coke 115, 118 (a),] the omnipotence of Parliament over the Common Law was absolute, even against common right and reason. The actual and practical security for English liberty against legislative tyranny was the power of a free public opinion represented by the Commons. In this country written Constitutions were deemed essen- tial to protect the rights and liberties of the people against the encroachments of power delegated to their gov- ernments and the provisions of Magna Charta were incorporat- ed in the bills of rights. They were limitations upon all the powers of government, legislative as well as executive and judicial."" This basic distinction between the two systems should never be lost sight of, if confusion of thought is to be avoided. Although our Constitution has imposed some limita- tions on the legislative authorities, yet subject to and outside such limitations our Constitution has left our Parliament and the State Legislatures supreme in their respective legislative fields. In the main, subject to the limitations I have mentioned, our Constitution has preferred the supremacy of the Legislature to that of the Judiciary. The English principle of due process of law is, therefore, more in accord with our Constitution than the American doctrine which has been evolved for serving quite a differ- ent system. The picturesque language of Bronson J. quoted above, while that is quite appropriate to the American Constitution which does not recognise the supremacy of the Congress, is wholly out of place in, and has no applica- tion to, a Constitution such as ours, which, subject only to certain restrictions, recognises the supremacy of the Legis- latures in their respective fields. In the next place, it is common knowledge that our Constitution-makers deliberate- ly declined to adopt the uncertain and shifting American doctrine of due process of law and substituted the words' ""except in due process of law"" that were in the original draft by the more specific expression ""except in accordance with procedure established by law."" To try to bring in the American doctrine, in spite of this fact, will be to stulti- fy the intention of the Constitution as expressed in article 21. In the third place, in view of the plain meaning of the language of that article as construed and explained above it is impossible to let in what have been called the principles of natural justice as adopted in the procedural due process of law by the American Supreme Court. Again, even the all-pervading little word ""due"" does not find a place in article 21 so as to qualify the procedure. It speaks of procedure and not ""due"" procedure and, therefore, ""the intellectual yardstick"" of the Court is definitely ruled out. Finally, it will be incongruous to import the doctrine of due process of law without its palliative, the doctrine of police powers. It is impossible to read the last mentioned doctrine into article 21. It has also been suggested as a compromise that this Court should adopt a middle course between the flexible principles of natural justice as adopted by the American doctrine of due process of law and the unbending rigidity of mere State-made laws. h is said that we have our Code of Criminal Procedure which embodies within its provisions certain salutary principles of procedure and we must insist that those underlying principles should be regarded as procedure established or settled Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 142 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 by our positive law. But who will say what are those fundamental principles? What principles. do I reject as inessential and what shall I adopt as fundamental ? What is fundamental to me today may not appear to be so to another Judge a decade hence, for principles give way with changing social conditions. In America it was suggested that due process of law should be taken to mean the general body of common law as it stood at the date of the Constitution. In Bardwell v. Collins (1) it was negatived in the following words: ""'Due process of law' does not mean the general body of the law, common and statute, as it was at the time the Constitution took effect; for that would deny the legisla- ture power to change or amend the law in any particular."" The Court, however, brought in principles of (1) 44 Minn. 97. natural justice under the due process clause. To sanctify what I may to-day regard as the basic principles underlying our Code of Criminal Procedure will be to make them immuta- ble and to prevent the legislature even to improve upon them. This is nothing but imposing on the legislature a limitation which the Constitution has not placed on it. I do not think it is a permissible adventure for the Court to undertake. It is a dangerous adventure, for it will bring about stagnation which means ruin. We must accept the Con- stitution which is the supreme law. The Constitution has by article 21 required a procedure and has prescribed certain minimum requirements of procedure in article 22. To add to them is not to interpret the Constitution but to recast it according to our intellectual yardstick and our unconscious predilections as to what an ideal Constitution should be. Article 21, in my judgment, only formulates a substan- tive fundamental right to life and personal liberty which in its content is not an absolute right but is a limited right having its ambit circumscribed by the risk of its being taken away by following a procedure established by law made by the appropriate legislative authority and the proximate purpose of article 21 is not to prescribe any particular procedure. It is to be kept in mind that at the date when the Constitution came into effect we had the Indian Penal Code creating diverse offences and a conviction for any of them would deprive a person of his personal liberty. Under article 246 read with Entry 1 of the Concurrent List, Par- liament or any State Legislature could add more offences and create further means for taking away personal liberty. But all this deprivation of personal liberty as a result of a conviction could only be done by following the procedure laid down by the Code of Criminal Procedure. Again, at the date of this Constitution there were preventive detention laws in almost every province and a person could be deprived of his personal liberty under those laws. Those laws, however, provided a procedure of a sort which had to be followed. Therefore, before the Constitution came into force, personal liberty could be taken away only by following the procedure enacted by the Criminal Procedure Code in the case of punitive detention or by the procedure enacted by the different Security Acts in case of preventive detention. Power, however, has been given to Parliament and the State Legislatures under article 246 read with Entry 2 of the Concurrent List to make laws with re- spect to Criminal Procedure. If that article stood by itself the Parliament or the State Legislature could repeal the whole of the Criminal Procedure Code and also do away even with the skeleton procedure provided in the Security Acts. If article 246 stood by itself then the appropriate legislative authority could have taken away the life and personal liberty of any person without any procedure at all. This absolute supremacy of the legislative authority has, however, been cut down by article 21 which delimits the ambit and scope of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 143 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 the substantive right to life and person- al liberty by reference to a procedure and by article 22 which prescribes the minimum procedure which must be fol- lowed. In this situation the only power of the Court is to determine whether the impugned law has provided some proce- dure and observed and obeyed the minimum requirements of article 29. and if it has, then it is not for the Court to insist on more elaborate procedure according to its notion or to question the wisdom of the legislative authority in enacting the particular law, however harsh, unreasonable, archaic or odious the provisions of that law may be. It is said that if this strictly technical interpreta- tion is put upon article 21 then it will not constitute a fundamental right at all and need not have been placed in the chapter on Fundamental Rights, for every person's life and personal liberty will be at the mercy of the Legislature which, by providing some sort of a procedure and complying with the few requirements of article 22, may, at any time, deprive a person of his life and liberty at its pleasure and whim. There are several answers to this line of argument. Article 21 as construed by me will, if nothing else, cer- tainly protect every person against the executive and as such will be as much a fundamental right deserving a place in the Constitution as the famous 39th Chapter of the Magna Charta was and is a bulwark of liberty in English law. It appears to me that article 21 of our Constitution read with article 32 also gives us some protection even against the legislative authority in that a person may only be deprived of his life and personal liberty in accordance with procedure which, although enacted by it, must at least conform to the requirements of article 22. Subject to this limitation our parliament or any State Legislature may enact any law and provide any procedure it pleases for depriving a person of his life and personal liberty under article 21. Such being the meaning of that article and the ambit and extent of the fundamental right of life and personal liberty which the people of this country have given unto themselves, any law for depriving any person of his life and personal liberty that may be made by the appropriate legislative authority under article 246 and in conformity with the requirements of article 22 does not take away or abridge any right conferred by article 21, for the very right conferred by that article is circumscribed by this possi- bility or risk and, therefore, such law cannot be regarded as violating the provisions of article 13 (2). Our Constitution is a compromise between Parliamentary supremacy of England and the supremacy of the Supreme Court of the United States. Subject to the limitations I have mentioned which are certainly justiciable, our Constitution has ac- cepted the supremacy of the legislative authority and, that being so, we must be prepared to face occasional vagaries of that body and to put up with enactments of the nature of the atrocious English statute to which learned counsel for the petitioner has repeatedly referred, namely, that the Bishop of Rochester's cook be boiled to death. If Parliament may take away life by providing for hanging by the neck, logi- cally there can be no objection if it provides a sentence of death by shooting by a firing squad or by guillotine or in the electric chair or even by boiling in oil. A procedure laid down by the legislature may offend against the Court's sense of justice and fair play and a sentence provided by the legislature may outrage the Court's notions of penology, but that is a wholly irrelevant consideration. The Court may construe and interpret the Constitution and ascertain its true meaning but once that is done the Court cannot question its wisdom or policy. The Constitution is supreme. The Court must take the Constitu- tion as it finds it, even if it does not accord with its preconceived notions of what an ideal Constitution should be. Our protection against legislative tyranny, if any, lies in ultimate analysis in a free and intelligent public opinion which must eventually assert itself. The conclusion I have arrived at does not introduce any novelty, for in many other Constitutions the supremacy of the legislature is recognised in the matter of depriving a person of his life, liberty and property. The English Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 144 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 Democratic Constitution is one in point. Take the Constitu- tion of the Irish Free State. Article 40 (4) (i) provides that no citizen shall be deprived of personal liberty save in accordance with law, and article 50 (5) guarantees that the dwelling of every citizen is inviolable and shall not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law. The words ""in accordance with law"" in both the above clauses must mean the same thing and I have no doubt in my mind, reading clause (5)that it means in accordance with the State-made law, for we have not been referred to any rule prescribed by natural justice regulating searches of, or entry into, dwelling houses. Article 107 (2) of the Czechoslovakian Constitution uses the words ""in accordance with law"" which, read with clause (1) of that article, obviously means the law to be made which will form part of the Constitution. Take the Constitution of the Free City of Danzig. Article74 of that Constitution which is in Part II headed ""Fundamental Bights and Duties"" provides as follows: ""The liberty of the person shall be inviolable. No limitation or deprivation of personal liberty may be imposed by public authority, except by virtue of a law."" The word"" law"" clearly cannot, in the context,mcan princi- ples of natural justice- Again, article 75 of that Consti- tution protects the freedom of movement within the Free City and the right to stay and to settle at any place, to acquire real property and to earn a living. It concludes by saying that this right shall not be curtailed without legal sanctions. Legal sanctions, in this context, can only mean sanctions of the City laws. Article 114 of the Weimar Constitution is on the same lines and expressed in almost the same language as article 74 of the Danzig Constitution. Take the Japanese Constitution of 1946 from which our arti- cle 21 is reputed to have been taken. Article XXXI of that Constitution says: No person shall be deprived of life or liberty nor shall any other criminal penalty be imposed, except according to procedure established by law."" Surely the words ""except according to procedure established by law"" in their application to the imposition of criminal penalty must mean State-made law and the same words in the same sentence in the same article cannot, according to ordi- nary rules of construction of statutes, mean a different thing in their application to deprivation of life or liber- ty. I am aware that it is not right to construe one Consti- tution in the light of another and that is not my purpose when I refer to the other Constitutions; but I do think that after reading the relevant provisions of other written Con- stitutions one sees quite clearly that there is no pressing special reason applicable to or inherent in written Consti- tutions which requires the importation of the principles of natural justice or of the American doctrine of due process of law into our Constitution. The several Constitutions referred to above have not adopted that American doctrine but have been content with leaving the life and liberty of their citizens to the care of the laws made by their legis- latures. It is no novelty if our Constitution has done the same. For all these reasons, in spite of the very able and attractive arguments of the learned counsel for the peti- tioner which I freely acknowledge, I am not convinced that there is any scope for the introduction into article 21 of our Constitution of the doctrine of due process of law even as regards Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 145 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 procedure. I may or may not like it, but that is the result of our Constitution as I understand it. The learned Attorney-General has referred to certain debates in the Constituent Assembly on the original clause which has now become article 21, not as evidence to be used in interpreting the language of article 21 but as disclos- ing the historical background. His purpose, he says, is to show that the framers of our Constitution had the essential difference in the meaning of the phrases ""due process of law"" and ""according to procedure established by law"" clearly explained to them, that they knew that the former implied the supremacy of the judiciary and the latter the supremacy of the legislature and with all that knowledge they deliber- ately agreed to reject the former expression and adopt the latter. As, in my opinion, it is possible to interpret the language of article 21 on the ordinary rules of interpreta- tion of statutes, I do not think it is at all necessary to refer to the debates. As I do not propose to refer to, or rely on, the debates for the purposes of this case, I express no opinion on the question of the admissibility or otherwise of the debates. I now pass on to article 22. The contention of learned counsel for the petitioner is that article 21 by reason of the last few words, ""according to procedure established by law"" attracts the four requirements of the American proce- dural due process of law as summarised by Willis to which reference has been made earlier, and that those require- ments, except to the extent they have been expressly abro- gated or modified by article 22, must be strictly followed before a person may be deprived of his life or personal liberties. I have already stated for reasons set forth above, that there is no scope for introducing any rule of natural justice or the American procedural due process of law or any underlying principle of our Code of Criminal Procedure into that article. This being the conclusion I have arrived at, the major premise assumed by learned coun- sel for the petitioner is missing and this line of argument does not begin and cannot be accepted. The learned Attorney-General, on the other hand. has at one stage of his argument, urged that article 21 has nothing to do with preventive detention at all and that preventive detention is wholly covered by article 22 (4) to (7) which by themselves constitute a complete code. I am unable to accede to this extreme point of view also. The true posi- tion, as I apprehend it, lies between the two extreme views. Article 21, to my mind, gives protection to life and person- al liberty to the extent therein mentioned. It does not recognise the right to life and personal liberty as an absolute right but delimits the ambit and scope of the right itself The absolute right is by the definition in that article cut down by the risk of its being taken away in accordance with procedure established by law. It is this circumscribed right which is substantively protected by article 21 as against the executive as well as the legislature, for the Constitution has conditioned its depri- vation by the necessity for a procedure established by law made by itself. While subclauses (2) to (6) of article 19 have put a limit on the fundamental rights of a citizen, articles 21 and 22 have put a limit on the power of the State given under article 246 read with the legislative lists. Under our Constitution our life and personal liberty are balanced by restrictions on the rights of the citizens as laid down in article 19 and by the checks put upon the State by articles 21 and 22. preventive detention deprives a person of his personal Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 146 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 liberty as effectively as does punitive detention and, therefore, personal liberty, circum- scribed as it is by the risk of its being taken away, re- quires protection against punitive as well as preventive detention. The language of article 21 is quite general and is wide enough to give its limited protection to personal liberty against all forms of detention. It protects a person against preventive detention by the executive without the sanction of a law made by the legislature. It prevents the legislature from taking away a person's personal liberty except in accordance with procedure established by law, although such law is to be by itself. If, as contended by the learned Attorney-General and held by me, article 19 only protects the rights of a free citizen as long as he is free and does not deal with total deprivation of personal liberty and if, as contended by the learned Attorney-General, article 21 does not protect a person against preventive detention then where is the protection for life and personal liberty as substantive rights which the procedural provisions of arti- cle 22 may protect ? What is the use of procedural protec- tion if there is no substantive right ? In my judgment article 21 protects the substantive rights by requiring a procedure and article 22 gives the minimum procedural pro- tection. Clauses (1) and (2) of article 22 lay down the procedure that has to be followed when a man is arrested. They ensure four things: (a) right to be informed regarding grounds of arrest, (b) right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice, (c) right to be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours and (d) freedom from detention beyond the said period except by order of the magis- trate. These four procedural requirements are very much similar to the requirements of the procedural due process of law as enumerated by Willis. Some of these salutary protections are also to be found in our Code of Criminal Procedure. If the procedure has already been prescribed by article 21 incorporating the principles of natural justice or the principles underlying our Code of Criminal Procedure what was the necessity of repeating them in clauses (1) and (2) of article 22 ? Why this unnecessary overlapping ? The truth is that article 21 does not prescribe any particular procedure but in defining the protection to life and person- al liberty merely envisages or indicates the necessity for a procedure and article 22 lays down the minimum rules of procedure that even Parliament cannot abrogate or overlook. This is so far as punitive detention is concerned. But clause (3) of article 22 expressly provides that none of the procedure laid down in clauses (1) and (2) shall apply to an alien enemy or to a person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention. It is thus expressly made clear that a detenu need not be produced before the magistrate and he is not to have the assistance of any lawyer for consultation or for defending him. Such being the express provision of our Constitution nobody can question its wisdom. So I pass on. Clauses (4), (5), (6) and (7) of article 22 in terms relate to preventive detention. Article 246 authorises the appropriate legislature to make a law for preventive deten- tion in terms of Entry 9 in List I and/or Entry 3 in List III of the Seventh Schedule. On this legislative power are imposed certain limitations by article 22 (4) to (7). According to this the legislature, whether it be Parliament Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 147 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 or a State Legislature, is reminded that no law made by it for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a longer period than three months except in two cases mentioned in sub-clauses (a) and (b). The proviso to sub-clause (a) and sub-clause (b) refer to a law made only by Parliament under clause (7). Under clause (7) it is Parliament alone and not any State Legislature that may prescribe what are specified in the three subclauses of that clause. Although a State Legislature may make a law for preventive detention in terms of Entry 3 in List III of the Seventh Schedule no such law may authorise detention for more than three months unless the provisions of sub-clauses (a)and (b) of clause (4) sanction such detention. Even a law made by Parliament cannot authorise detention for more than three months unless it is a law made under the provi- sions of clause (7). In short, clause (4) of article 22 provides a limitation on the legislative power as to the period of preventive detention. Apart from imposing a limitation on the legislative power, clause (4) also pre- scribes a procedure of detention for a period longer than three months by providing for an advisory board. Then comes clause (5). It lays down the procedure that has to be fol- lowed when a person is detained under any law providing for preventive detention, namely, (a) the grounds of the order of detention must be communicated to the detenu as soon as may be, and (b) the detenu must be afforded the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order. The first requirement takes the place of notice and the second that of a defence or hearing. These are the only compulsory procedural requirements laid down by our Constitution. There is nothing to prevent the Legislature from providing an elaborate procedure regulating preventive detention but it is not obliged to do so. If some procedure is provided as envisaged by article 21 and the compulsory requirements of article 22 are obeyed and carried out nobody can, under our Constitution, as I read it, complain of the law providing for preventive detention. Learned counsel for the petitioner concedes that the four requirements of procedural due process summarised by Willis will have to be modified in their application to preventive detention. Thus he does not insist on a prior notice before arrest, for he recognises that such a require- ment may frustrate the very object of preventive detention by giving an opportunity to the person in question to go underground. The provision in clause (5) for supplying grounds is a good substitute for notice. He also does not insist that the Tribunal to judge the reasonableness of the detention should be a judicial tribunal. He will be satis- fied if the tribunal or advisory board, as it is called in article 22 of the Constitution, is an impartial body and goes into the merits of the order of detention and its decision is binding on the executive government. He insists that the detenu must have a reasonable and effective oppor- tunity to put up his defence. He does not insist on the assistance of counsel, for that is expressly taken away by the Constitution itself. But he insists on what he calls an effective opportunity of being heard in person before an impartial tribunal which will be free to examine the grounds of his detention and whose decision should be binding alike on the detenu and the executive authority which detains. The claim may be reasonable but the question before the Court is not reasonableness or otherwise of the provisions of article 22 (4) to (7). Those provisions are not justicia- ble, for they are the provisions of the Constitution itself which is supreme over everybody. The Court can only seek to find out, on a proper construc- tion, what protection has in fact been provided. The Consti- tution has provided for the giving of the grounds of deten- tion although facts Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 148 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 as distinguished from grounds may be withheld under clause (6) and the right of representation against the order of detention. It has provided for the duration of the detention. There the guaranteed fundamental procedural rights end. There is no provision for any trial before any tribunal. One cannot import the condition of a trial by any tribunal from the fact that a right of repre- sentation has been given. The right to make representation is nothing more than the right to ""lodge objections"" as provided by the Danzig Constitution and the Weimar Constitu- tion. The representations made will no doubt be considered by the Government. It is said a prosecutor cannot be himself the judge. Ordinarily, the orders of detention will in a great majority of cases be made by the District Magistrate or Sub-Divisional Officer or the Commissioner of Police. The representation of the detenu goes to the Government. Why should it be assumed that a high government official at the seat of the government will not impartially consider the representation and judge the propriety of the order of detention made by local officials ? Clause (5) does not imperatively provide for any oral representation which a hearing will entail. Indeed the exclusion of the provisions of clauses (1) and (2) negatives any idea of trial or oral defence. The Court may not, by temperament and training, like this at all but it cannot question the wisdom or the policy of the Constitution. In my judgment as regards pre- ventive detention laws, the only limitation put upon the legislative power is that it must provide some procedure and at least incorporate the minimum requirements laid down in article 22 (4) to (7). There is no limitation as regards the substantive law. Therefore, a preventive detention law which provides some procedure and complies with the require- ments of article 22 (4) to (7) must be held to be a good law, however odious it may appear to the Court to be. Learned counsel for the petitioner contends -that the impugned Act does not comply with even the bare requirements of article 22 (4) to (7). It is pointed out that section 3 of the Act does not lay down any objective test but leaves it to the authority to define and say whether a particular person comes within the legislative heads. In other words, it is contended that Parliament has not legislated at all but has delegated its legislative powers to the executive authorities. I do not think there is any substance in this contention. In the first place this is not an objection as to procedure but to substantive law which is not open to the Court's scrutiny. In the next place this contention over- looks the basic distinction between the delegation of power to make the law and the conferring of an authority and discretion as to its execution to be exercised under and in pursuance of the law. The impugned Act has specifically set forth an ascertainable standard by which the conduct of a particular person is to be judged by the detaining authori- ty. It is next urged that section 12 of the Act does not comply with the requirements of clause (7) of article 22 for two reasons, namely-- (i) that clause (7) contemplates a law prescribing the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months and then another law thereafter providing for preventive detention for a period longer than three months; and (ii) that under clause (7) Parliament must prescribe both the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 149 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 As regards the first point I do not see why Parliament must make two laws, one laying down the principles for longer detention and another for detention for such longer period. It may be that a State cannot provide for longer detention until Parliament has made the law, but I can see no reason why Parliament cannot do both by the same Act. In fact, clause (4) (b) contemplates the detention itself to be in accordance with the provisions of any law made by Parliament under sub- clauses (a) and (b) of clause (7). Therefore, the detention can well be under the very law which the Parliament makes under sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (7). As to the second point the argument is that Parliament has a discre- tion under clause (7) to make a law and it is not obliged to make any law but when our Parliament chooses to make a law it must prescribe both the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months. I am unable to construe clause (7) (a) in the way suggested by learned counsel for the petitioner. It is an enabling provision empowering Parliament to prescribe two things. Parliament may prescribe either or both. H a father tells his delicate child that he may play table tennis and badminton but not the strenuous game of football, it obviously does not mean that tim child, if he chooses to play at all, must play both table tennis and badminton. It is an option given to the child. Likewise, the Constitution gives to Parliament the power of prescribing two things. Parliament is not obliged to prescribe at all but if it chooses to prescribe it may prescribe either or both. Clause 7 (a), in my opinion, has to be read distributively as follows: The Parliament may prescribe the circumstance under which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months and Parlia- ment may prescribe the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months. That appears to me to be consonant with sound rules of construction. Further, the circumstances and the class or classes of cases may conceivably coalesce. Indeed the Full Bench case No. 1 of 1950 before the Calcutta High Court (Kshitindra Narayan v. The Chief Secretary) itself indicates that the same provision may be read as circumstances or as a classification. In that case learned counsel conceded that section 12 had prescribed the circumstances but his com- plaint was that it had not prescribed the class or classes of cases. The majority of the Court repelled this contention. One learned Judge howev- er, held that section 12 had prescribed the class or classes of cases but had not prescribed the circumstances. It is, therefore, clear that the classification itself may indicate the circumstances. Again, the classification may be on a variety of bases. It may be according to provinces the detenus come from. It may be according to the age of the detenus. It may be according to the object they are supposed to have in view or according to the activities they are suspected to be engaged in. In this case Parliament has taken five out of the six legislative heads and divided them into two categories. The detenus are thus classified ac- cording to their suspected object or activities endangering the several matters specified in the section. I do not see why classification cannot be made on the footing of the objectives of the detenus falling in some of the legislative heads, for each legislative head has a specific connotation well understood in law. If I am correct that there has been a classification then the fact that a person falls within one or the other class may well be the circumstances under which he may be detained for a period longer than three months. I do not consider it right, as a matter of con- struction, to read any further limitation in clause 7 (a) of article 22. In my judgment Par]lament was not obliged under clause (7) to prescribe both circumstances and classes, and in any case has in fact and substance prescribed both. I am conscious that a law made by Parliament under article 22 (7)will do away with the salutary safeguard of the opinion of an advisory board. But it must be remembered that our Constitution itself contemplates that in certain circumstances or for certain class or classes of Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 150 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 detenus even the advisory board may not be safe and it has trusted Parliament to make a law for that purpose. Our preference for an advisory board should not blind us to this aspect of the matter. It is true that circumstances ordinarily relate to extraneous things, like riots, commotion, political or communal or some sort of abnormal situation and it is said that the framers of the Constitution had in mind some such situation when the advisory board might be done away with. It is also urged that they had in mind that the more dangerous types of detenus should be denied the privi- lege of the advisory board. I am free to confess that prescription of specific circumstances or a more rigid and definite specification of classes would have been better and more desirable. But that is crying for the ideal. The Constitution has not in terms put any such limitation as regards the circumstances or the class or classes of cases and it is idle to speculate as to the intention of the Constitution-makers, who, by the way, are the very persons who made this law. It is not for the Court to improve upon or add to the Constitution. If the law duly made by Parlia- ment is repugnant to good sense, public opinion will compel Parliament to alter it suitably. Finally, an objection is taken that section 14 of the impugned Act takes away or abridges the right of the detenu to move this Court by appropriate proceedings. Both clauses (1) and (2) of article 32 speak of enforcement of rights conferred by Part III. The right to move this Court is given to a person not for the sake of moving only but for moving the Court for the enforcement of some rights conferred by Part III and this Court has been given power to issue direc- tions or orders or writs for the enforcement of any of such rights. In order, therefore, to attract the application of article 32, the person applying must first satisfy that he has got a right under Part III which has to be enforced under article 32. I have already said that article 19 does not deal with the freedom of the person. I have also said that articles 21 and 22 provide for protection by insisting on some procedure. Under article 22 (5) the authority making the order of detention is enjoined, as soon as may be, to communicate to the detenu the grounds on which that order has been made. This provision has some purpose, name- ly, that the disclosure of the grounds will afford the detenu the opportunity of making a representation against the order. Supposing the authority does not give any grounds at all as distinct from facts referred to in Clause (6). Surely, the detenu loses a fundamental right because he is prevented from making a representation against the order. of deten- tion. Suppose the authority hands over to the detenu a piece of paper with some scribblings on it which do not amount to any ground at all for detention. Then also the detenu can legitimately complain that his right has been infringed. He can then come to the Court to get redress under article 32, but he cannot show to the Court the piece of paper with the scribblings on it under section 14 of the Act and the Court cannot judge whether he has actually got the grounds which he is entitled to under article 22 (5). In. such a case the detenu may well complain that both his substantive right under article 22 (5)' as well as his right to constitutional remedies under article 32 have been in- fringed. He can complain of infringement of his remedial rights under article 32, because he cannot show that there has been an infringement of his substantive right under article 22 (5). It appears to me, therefore, that section 14 of the Act in so far as it prevents the detenu from disclosing to the Court the grounds communicated to him is not in conformity with Part III of the Constitution and is, therefore, void under article 13 (2). That section, howev- er, is clearly severable and cannot affect the whole Act. On this question the views of Meredith C.J. and Das J. of Patna in Criminal Miscellaneous No. 124 of 1950 (Lalit Kumar Barman v. The State) and the majority of the learned Judges of the Calcutta High Court in Full Bench Case No. 1 of 1950 (Kshitindra Narayan v. The Chief Secretary) appear to be correct and Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1857950/ 151 A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950 sound. For the reasons I have given above, in my opinion, the impugned Act is a valid law except as to section 14 in so far as it prevents the grounds being disclosed to the Court. The petitioner before us does not complain that he has not got proper grounds. Further, the period of his detention under the impugned Act has not gone beyond three months and, in the circumstances, this application should, in my opinion, stand dismissed. Petition dismissed.

Trivedi, Aniruddha Bose 2024 INSC 71 REPORTABLE IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1543 OF 2016 BAITULLA ISMAIL SHAIKH AND ANR. …APPELLANT(S) VERSUS KHATIJA ISMAIL PANHALKAR AND ORS. …RESPONDENT(S) WITH CIVIL APPEAL NO. 1544 OF 2016 JUDGMENT ANIRUDDHA BOSE, J. The appellants before us are landlords and they assail a judgment delivered by a Single Judge of the Bombay High Court on 04.08.2015 exercising his revisional jurisdiction invalidating eviction decrees against two tenants in respect of two portions of the same building. The building in question carries House No.86 as per the municipal records, comprised in C.S. No. 111/b as per city survey records, located at Dr. Sobane Road in Mahabaleshwar, District-Satara within the State of Maharashtra. The Civil Appeal No. 1543 of 2016 arises out of Civil Suit No. 136 of 2010 and the tenant/defendant in that suit is one Khatija Ismail Panhalkar. In this suit, two of his sons have also been impleaded as defendants. The premises involved in these proceedings comprise of two blocks within the aforesaid building. One block comprises of 10’×4’ structure made of ‘ita and tin shed’. Civil Appeal No. 1544 of 2016 arises out of Civil Suit No. 137 of 2010 and the tenant whose eviction is sought for in this suit is one Vasant Mahadeo Gujar (since deceased). Before us, his legal representatives have contested the appeal. The property from which the appellants want them to be evicted comprises of two rooms comprising of an area of 10’×12’, which appears to be located in the middle of the said building. The two rooms, at the material point of time, were being used for residential purpose. The appellants purchased the subject-premises in the year 1992 from its Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37471337/ 1 Baitulla Ismail Shaikh And Anr vs Khatija Ismail Panhalkar And Ors. on 30 January, 2024 erstwhile owner. Both the tenants were inducted by the erstwhile owner of the building in question. 2. On 23.01.2002, a demolition notice was issued by the Mahabaleshwar Giristhan Municipal Council for a part of the subject-building. This notice constituted one of the grounds on which the appellants wanted to evict the respondents under the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999 (“the 1999 Act”). This notice was followed by three subsequent notices by the said Municipal Council on 03.12.2005, 13.07.2009 and 05.07.2010, almost on similar terms. The suit, however, was founded on, inter-alia, the notice dated 23.01.2002. This notice is of relevance so far as these appeals are concerned and we quote below the text thereof:- “ANNEXURE P- 1 MAHABALESHWAR GIRISTHAN MUNICIPAL COUNCIL, MAHABALESHWAR, DIST.

Notices for eviction were subsequently sent to the tenants in each appeal and both these notices are dated 04.02.2002. So far as the notice to the respondents in Civil Appeal No. 1543 of 2016 is concerned, the delivery of vacant possession was asked for on five main grounds. The first one was default in payment of rent. The next ground was erection of a permanent structure by the tenant Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37471337/ 2 Baitulla Ismail Shaikh And Anr vs Khatija Ismail Panhalkar And Ors. on 30 January, 2024 without permission of the landlord. The third point was subletting and it was also stated in that notice that the landlords had decided to construct a building thereon for residential purpose as also for operating a hotel. Under Section 16(1)(i) of the 1999 Act, the erection of a new building could come within “reasonable and bona fide” requirement of landlord, subject to satisfaction of certain other stipulated conditions. The municipality’s demolition notice was also cited as a ground for eviction. We shall reproduce provisions of Sections 15 and 16 of the said enactment in subsequent paragraphs of this judgment. In the eviction notice to the respondent in Civil Appeal No. 1544 of 2016, the grounds cited were, inter-alia, issue of the demolition notice by the municipality, default in payment of rent and also necessity of the tenanted portion for construction of a new building upon demolishing the structures on the land. 4. As the eviction notices did not yield any result, the two suits were instituted on the same date, i.e. 07.08.2002. These suits appear to have had been tried simultaneously and they were decreed by the Trial Court, which was sustained by the Appellate Court. In the Civil Revision Petition, the tenants succeeded as the judgment and decree were set aside. 5. In course of the proceeding before the Trial Court, a Commissioner was appointed. He was an architect. His opinion, however, was not accepted by the Trial Court. He had given his opinion that a portion referred to as “C” in his report was dangerous and was required to be demolished. This portion, however, was in possession of the plaintiffs only, but adjacent to the suit property (in Civil Appeal No. 1543 of 2016). Though his report dated 08.12.2008 carries the caption of suit no. (239 of 2002) 136 of 2010, the report was examined by the Trial Court in connection with both the suits. His report on the necessity of urgent demolition of the tenanted portions was not fully conclusive but his view was that the entire building was about 97 years old and life of the building was over. His opinion has been referred to and dealt with by the Trial Court in the following terms:- “16) In this respect I have perused evidence of D.W.1 Vivek and his commission report at Exh.122. It is pertinent to note that in the commission report Exh.122, the commissioner has given actual position of every room situated in C.T.S.No.111/B. In his conclusion he has opined that, the building is approximately 96 to 97 years old and the life of building is over. Considering all the material he opined that the portion shown as 'C' in the map is dangerous and is required to be demolished. It is important to note that, said portion shown as 'C' is the room which is in possession of plaintiffs and adjacent to suit property. The commissioner has also filed number of photographs showing the position of property at Exh. 135 to Exh. 148. Further, if D.W.1 Vivek's deposition is perused it is clear that he has supported his commission report. In cross examination, he admitted that, if the cementing strength of soi! used for construction is gone then there may be cracks to the wall ·and to reconstruct the said wall the previous wall is required to be demolished, further, if the base of construction is not strong then new construction can also collapse. He further admitted that, if the portion shown by red ink in the map i.e. 'C' is demolished the entire roof on the property is also required to be removed and if said roof is removed it will create danger to the roof of the property on the western side and ta the roof on 'B' portion. Further, if total evidence of D.W.1 Vivek is considered it cannot be said Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37471337/ 3 Baitulla Ismail Shaikh And Anr vs Khatija Ismail Panhalkar And Ors. on 30 January, 2024 that, he had opined that, suit property is in dilapidated condition though he had admitted that the life of suit property is over.” (Emphasis supplied) 6. It would be evident from this part of the judgment of the Trial Court that there was no specific finding that the portions in respect of which the respondents have tenancy required immediate demolition. It was a portion of the premises in possession of the landlords which, in the opinion of the Commissioner was dangerous. The Trial Court proceeded on the basis that it could not sit in appeal over the decision of Municipal Council requiring demolition. On plaintiffs’ plea of default, the Trial Court rejected that contention holding that the tenants were ready and willing to pay the rent of the suit property and during the pendency of the suit, they had deposited the rent. The Trial Court also rejected the landlord’s contention that the subject- property was sublet or permanent structure was made without consent of the landlord. The Trial Court, however, opined that the landlord was the best judge of his own requirement and on that basis the issue of bona fide need was decided in favour of the appellants. 7. The Appellate Court sustained the judgment and decree on the ground of bona fide need as also necessity to effect demolition of the subject-building. In addition, it overturned the Trial Court’s finding on there being no default in payment of rent on the ground that the provisions of Section 15(3) of the 1999 Act could not support the tenant’s case. On the question of permanent structure having been made by the respondent in Civil Appeal No. 1543 of 2016 without permission of the landlord and question of sub-letting, the Trial Court’s decision was sustained. 8. The Revisional Court on analysing the provisions of Sections 15 and 16 of the said Statute set aside the judgment and decree and allowed the revision applications of the tenants. 9. The provisions of Sections 15 and 16 of the 1999 Act stipulate:- “15. No ejectment ordinarily to be made if tenant pays or is ready and willing to pay standard rent and permitted increases. (1) A landlord shall not be entitled to the recovery of possession of any premises so long as the tenant pays, or is ready and willing to pay, the amount of the, standard rent and permitted increases, if any, and observes and performs the other, conditions of the tenancy, in so far as they are consistent with the provisions of this Act. (2) No suit for recovery of possession shall be instituted by a landlord against the tenant on the ground of non- payment of the standard rent or permitted increases due, until the expiration of ninety days next after notice in writing of the demand of the standard rent or permitted increases has been served upon the tenant in the manner provided in section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. (3) No decree for eviction shall be passed by the court in any suit for recovery of possession on the ground of arrears of standard rent and permitted increases if, within a period of ninety days from Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37471337/ 4 Baitulla Ismail Shaikh And Anr vs Khatija Ismail Panhalkar And Ors. on 30 January, 2024 the date of service of the summons of the suit, the tenant pays or tenders in court the standard rent and permitted increases then due together with simple interest on the amount of arrears at fifteen per cent per annum; and thereafter continues to pay or tenders in court regularly such standard rent and permitted increases till the suit is finally decided and also pays cost of the suit as directed by the court. (4) Pending the disposal of any suit, the court may, out of any amount paid or tendered by the tenant, pay to the landlord such amount towards the payment of rent or permitted increases due to him as the court thinks fit. 16.

(10) A suit for eviction on the grounds specified in clause (h), (i), (i) or (k) of sub-section (1) may be filed by the landlord jointly against all the tenants occupying the premises sought to be demolished.” 10. The eviction proceeding was instituted in the suit giving rise to Civil Appeal No.1543 of 2016 against the appellants, inter-alia, on the grounds of having made construction of permanent nature by extending the area of the shop premises, without the landlords’ consent, causing permanent damage to the property in question, causing nuisance and annoyance to the adjoining area and neighbouring occupiers as also inducting a relative as sub- tenant. It was pleaded by the appellants that because of rusting of beams holding the tenanted structure, the roof of the rented property was damaged as a result of which it had become dangerous for the occupation of human beings. Demolition notice issued by Mahabaleshwar Giristhan Municipal Council to the landlords dated 23.01.2002 was relied upon in the plaint in this regard. So far as the suit forming the basis of Civil Appeal No.1544 of 2016 is concerned, the grounds for eviction were default in the payment of rent, demolition notice having been issued by the Municipal Council on 23.01.2002, as also for necessity of having the premises for the purpose of carrying out construction for residential purpose and hotel. This requirement, the appellant argued, constituted bona fide requirement by the landlord. On the finding of the Appellate Court that there was default in payment of rent, the High Court held:- “12(c) The Appeal Court has committed an error of law, apparent on face of record in interpreting Section 15 of the Rent Act, in the manner it has. The interpretation is contrary to both, the text as well as the rulings of this Court on the subject. This is a case where ·rents were regularly offered and dispatched by way of money orders. The rents were, however, refused by the landlords. In such circumstances, there is no obligation upon the tenants to comply with conditions prescribed in Section 15(3) of the Rent Act. It is always open to a tenant to establish and prove that the tenant was always ready and willing to pay rent and therefore, there was no cause of action to even initiate proceedings for eviction under Section 15(1) of the Rent Act. Besides, a Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37471337/ 9 Baitulla Ismail Shaikh And Anr vs Khatija Ismail Panhalkar And Ors. on 30 January, 2024 careful perusal of the impugned orders would indicate that concurrently the two Courts have accepted that there was no default in payment of rents. There is, in any case, ample evidence on record to establish that there was no default in payment of rent;” 11. The Revisional Court examining the question of reasonable and bona fide requirement of the landlords found eviction was sought for demolishing the suit premises and erecting a new building thereon. In the opinion of the High Court, it was incumbent on the part of the fact finding fora to come to a finding on that question and record satisfaction as required under sub- sections (4), (5), (6) and (7) of Section 16 of the 1999 Act. We have quoted above Section 16 of the 1999 Act. The High Court appears to have connected the claim based on reasonable and bona fide requirement to Sections 16 (1)(h) and (i) of the said statute. Though these two provisions apply in different contexts, sub- section (4) thereof requires the Court to carry out an exercise to determine which part of the rented-out premises ought to be vacated for carrying out the work of repair or erection. The first two fora did not address this question, which is a statutory requirement. A three-Judge Bench of this Court, in the case of P. ORR & Sons (P) Ltd. -vs- Associated Publishers (Madras) Ltd. [(1991) 1 SCC 301] dealing with a provision similar to Section 16(1)(i) contained in the rent legislation for the State of Tamil Nadu, Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1960 opined that the condition of building had to be considered for determining the legitimacy of the demand for timely demolition by reason of extent of damage to the structure, apart from considering other factors. It was also pointed out in this judgment that there was no necessity of the building being in crumbling condition to invoke the said provision. This view was echoed in a Constitution Bench judgment of this Court in the case of Vijay Singh and Others -vs- Vijayalakshmi Ammal [(1996) 6 SCC 475]. But these authorities do not clash with the reasoning of the High Court anchored on Section 16(4) of the 1999 Act. That provision lays down an entirely different test, and that is to ascertain if part-demolition could save the tenant’s interest. Dealing with claim based on Section 16(1)(h) and (i) of the 1999 Act, the statutory mandate for the Court is to test the question of part vacating. Neither the Trial Court nor the Appellate Court chose to analyse this requirement before directing eviction. This provision becomes relevant as the initial demolition notice identifies a part of the premises requiring demolition and the Commissioner’s report is also on that line. Sub-section (2) of Section 16 relates to reasonable and bona fide need in terms of Section 16(1)(g) and if the requirement is in the aforesaid terms, then the Court has to be satisfied having regard to all the circumstances of the case including the question whether other reasonable accommodation is available to the landlord or the tenant. This provision essentially incorporates the principle of “comparative hardship”, as such a test has come to be known in tenancy jurisprudence. We have been taken through the judgments of the Trial Court and the Appellate Court on this point. The Appellate Court came to the finding that balance on this point tilts in favour of the landlord. The High Court rejected this finding, holding:- “54] However, the respondent-landlords, have not at all been candid with the Court insofar as the pleadings are concerned. In the course of evidence, it has come on record that the respondent-landlords have, besides the suit premises several other Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37471337/ 10 Baitulla Ismail Shaikh And Anr vs Khatija Ismail Panhalkar And Ors. on 30 January, 2024 premises, which are being used by them for purposes of commerce as well as residence. Some of the premises, may have been acquired post the institution of the suit including in particular, the premises acquired by one of the sons of Baitullah Shaikh. Nevertheless, there were no disclosures volunteered in the course of examination-in-chief. Even if, the premises subsequently acquired are left out of consideration, there was a duty upon the respondent-landlords to fully and candidly make disclosure about the premises in their occupation, both for the purposes of residence as well as commerce and thereafter to explain, howsoever briefly, the subsistence of the need in respect of suit premises. The respondent- landlords have completely failed in this aspect. Such non- disclosure is a relevant consideration in the context of determining both the reasonability as well as bona fides. 55] The tenants have managed to bring on record the material in the context of occupation and control of several premises by the respondent-landlords. Looking to the conduct of the respondent- landlords, there is no certainty as to whether the premises in respect of which the tenants have obtained and produced documents, are only premises which are in the occupation or control of the respondent-landlords or whether there are some others as well. However, even on basis of the existing material on record, there was no question of making any decree under Section 16(1) (g) of the Rent Act.” We affirm the view taken by the High Court that there was no satisfaction in the manner contemplated in Section 16 (2) of the 1999 Act as far as bona fide need in terms of Section 16(1)(g) was concerned. In the impugned judgment, the High Court has dealt with in detail the list of properties which were with the landlords and on that basis gave its own finding in that regard. We do not find any perversity in such view taken by the High Court. 12. Sub-section (6) of Section 16 also mandates satisfaction of the conditions stipulated in sub-clauses (a) to (d) thereof. Sub- clause (d) in particular, contemplates the landlord to give undertaking in terms of paragraphs (i), (ii), (iv) and (v) of that sub- clause, while dealing with landlord’s eviction claim based on Section 16(1)(i) of the said statute. These are all mandatory requirements and we cannot find any flaw with the judgment of the High Court to the extent it rejects the claim of the landlord for non-compliance of the aforesaid provisions. 13. Section 16(1)(k) of the said Act permits recovery of possession of tenanted premises on the ground that the premises are required for immediate purpose of demolition ordered by any municipal or other competent authority. In the present case, the respective suits were instituted seeking recovery of possession, inter-alia, under this provision. We have already referred to the demolition notice issued by the municipal authority. The High Court opined that it was necessary to satisfy itself that the suit premises were required for immediate purpose of demolition. Contention of the appellants is that the Statute does not require the Court to come to a satisfaction on this point. Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37471337/ 11 Baitulla Ismail Shaikh And Anr vs Khatija Ismail Panhalkar And Ors. on 30 January, 2024 In the event a tenant questions immediacy of demolition, then the proper course for him would be to question legality of the said notice. Section 195 of the Maharashtra Municipal Councils, Nagar Panchayats and Industrial Townships Act, 1965 (“1965 Act”) to which the High Court has also referred to, stipulates:- “195. (1) If it shall at any time appear to the Chief Officer that any building or other structure or anything affixed to such building or structure is in a ruinous condition or likely to fall, or in any way dangerous to any person occupying, resorting to or passing by such building or structure or any other structure or place in the neighbourhood thereof, the Chief Officer may, by written notice, require the owner or occupier of such building or structure to pull down, secure, remove or repair such building, structure or thing or do one or more such things and to prevent all causes of danger therefrom. (2) The Chief Officer may also, if he thinks fit, require the said owner or occupier, by the said notice, either forthwith or before proceeding to put down, secure, remove or repair the said building, structure or thing, to set up a proper and sufficient board or fence for the protection of passers by and other persons. (3) If it appears to the Chief Officer that the danger from a building, structure or thing which is ruinous or about to fall is of hourly imminence he shall, before giving notice as aforesaid or before the period of notice expires, fence of, take down, secure or repair the said structure or take such steps or cause such work to be executed as may be required to arrest the danger. (4) Any expenses incurred by the Chief Officer under sub- section (3) shall be paid by the owner or occupier of the structure and shall be recoverable in the same manner as an amount due on account of a property tax.” 14. The High Court found fault with the demolition notice as it carried no reference to the said provision (Section 195 of the 1965 Act). This flaw, by itself would not make the notice unenforceable. Omission to label a notice with the provision under which it is issued would not make it nugatory, if substance thereof is clearly conveyed. But the High Court also found:- “76…Further, the notice is not directly in the context of suit premises occupied by the tenants, but rather pertains to certain portions of House No.86B. The notice, does not require demolition of the entire House No.86B, but rather requires removal of portions thereof, including in particular eastern wall, rafters and roofing. On basis of such notice, it is difficult to sustain an eviction order under Section 16(1)(k) of the Rent Act, particularly where no satisfaction whatsoever has been recorded by the two Courts on the aspect of 'immediate purpose of demolition', which satisfaction, was required to be recorded, both in terms of the context of Section 16(1)(k) of the Rent Act as also the decision of this Court in case of M.L Sonavane (supra). 77] There is yet Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37471337/ 12 Baitulla Ismail Shaikh And Anr vs Khatija Ismail Panhalkar And Ors. on 30 January, 2024 another significant aspect in the context of order of eviction under Section 16(1)(k) of the Rent Act. On 6 August 2002, the tenants lodged the complaint to the Municipal Authorities that the landlord Baitulla Shaikh was deliberately indulging in weakening of the walls of the portion of House N0.86, in his possession, with the objective of weakening the entire structure. Based upon such complaint, on 29 August 2002, an inspection was held by the Municipal Authority. Upon finding some merit in the complaint of the tenants, the decision was taken to issue appropriate notice to the landlords Baitulla Shaikh and C.K. Aris, Hamid. Pursuant to such decision, the Municipal Authority, by notice dated 29 August 2002, notified the landlords that during inspection it was revealed that the landlords are illegally and unauthorisedly weakening the walls of House No. 86 and that in future, if the wall collapses and causes loss to the life and property of the tenants, then, it is the landlords, who will be entirely responsible for the same. The documents like compliant of the tenants, inspection report as well as notice dated 29 August 2002 have been proved in the course of evidence and have been marked as Exhibits 223, 224 and 225. This vital material has been completely ignored by the two Courts. Exclusion of relevant and vital material, is also a species of perversity in the record of any finding of fact. The Court Commissioner was also appointed and even the Report of the Court Commissioner does not make out the case that the premises were required for immediate purpose of demolition. The evidence of the Municipal Engineers as well as the Court Commissioner, at the highest indicates that certain portions of House No.86 are in need of repairs. But the evidence does not make out any case that the suit premises were required for the immediate purpose of demolition. By virtually ignoring such material, the two Courts have proceeded to make a decree of eviction under Section 16(1)(k) of the Rent Act. This is an exercise in excess of jurisdiction. There is both illegality as well as material irregularity in the record of findings of fact, inasmuch as the Courts have failed to ask itself correct question in the context of 'immediate purpose' and further failed to consider relevant circumstances, rather the two Courts have allowed themselves to be persuaded by irrelevant circumstances.” (quoted verbatim from the paperbook) 15. Scope of Section 195 of the 1965 Act has been examined by the Bombay High Court in its judgment in the case of M.L. Sonavane -vs- C.G. Sonar [1981 (1) All India Rent Control Journal 466]. It is recorded in this judgment:- “25. The more pertinent question however, is, whether the satisfaction of a local authority can be a substitute for the satisfaction of a court. The court must be satisfied as the section says of two things. It must be satisfied that a decree for possession has to be passed against a tenant and secondly, “premises are required for the immediate purposes of demolition.” Unless the court is satisfied about the existence of both these things, it would be difficult to see how a court can pass a decree for eviction against a tenant. The satisfaction must relate to the requirement of passing a decree for possession against the tenant, and the immediate necessity of demolition. The satisfaction of the court is not a substitute for the satisfaction of the Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37471337/ 13 Baitulla Ismail Shaikh And Anr vs Khatija Ismail Panhalkar And Ors. on 30 January, 2024 local authority. Nor is it that the court must itself inquire that the premises are in such a ruinous condition that they are required to be demolished. That satisfaction is relegated to the local authority. But, even apart from that satisfaction, an area of satisfaction is still reserved for the court by the terms of the section, which deals with that satisfaction with regard to the passing of a decree for possession against the tenant, such satisfaction has also to be with regard to the immediate purpose of demolition. It is there and under those circumstances that the subsequent events and actions enter into the considerations of the court. If the court is satisfied on a consideration of the subsequent events that the premises are not required “for the immediate purposes of demolition,” then, notwithstanding the order passed, upon a bona fide exercise of the power by the local authority, the court may still refuse to pass a decree. To my mind, that is the decision and principle laid down in 72 Bombay Law Reporter 569 and the judgment of Justice Patel referred earlier.” 16. After holding that the satisfaction contemplated in the aforesaid provision is that of the local authority in a suit for eviction, it has been held that an area of satisfaction is still reserved for the Court. Court has to examine if there is immediacy of the need for demolition. Broadly, the same view has been taken by the Bombay High Court in a later judgment, in the case of Manohar Prabhumal Rajpal -vs- Satara City Municipal Corporation, Satara and Another [(1993) 1 All India Rent Control Journal 81]. In this judgment, the Court dealt with an eviction suit filed under the provisions of Section 13(1)(hhh) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 (“1947 Act”). The said provision is near identical to the provisions of Section 16(1)(k) of the Rent Control Act, 1999. While analysing the said provision of the 1947 Act, the High Court had held that the Trial Court while examining a plea for decree under similar statutory provision cannot sit in appeal over the decision of the local authority once the latter had exercised its power after taking into relevant factors into consideration. In our opinion, these two decisions lay down the correct principles of law for construing the provisions of Section 16(1)(k) of the 1999 Act. We accept the appellant’s argument that the Court trying an eviction proceeding under the aforesaid provision has very limited role in determining as to whether demolition is really necessary or not, but it does not automatically follow therefrom that the Court would mechanically adopt the view of municipal authority of there being urgent need of demolition. The conditions under which a landlord can bring an eviction action under clauses (i) and (k) of Section 16(1) are different in their operations. In respect of an eviction proceeding founded on the former provision, it contemplates a lesser degree of immediacy or urgency, as held in the Constitution Bench judgment which we have referred to above. But the latter provision requires a greater degree of urgency and it is within the jurisdiction of the Court to test this factor, as held in the cases of M.L. Sonvane (supra) and Manohar P. Rampal (supra). Both the fact finding fora failed on this count. 17. On behalf of the appellants, it was brought to our notice that after the first demolition notice on 23.01.2002, three other notices were issued. Obviously the two fact finding Courts did not consider these notices as they did not form part of cause of action and it also does not appear that the said facts were admitted to be brought on the record by way of amendment of plaint or otherwise. These notices would run their own course and we also do not want to take cognizance of these subsequent notices as it would be up to the authorities to take such steps as may be permissible in law in respect Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37471337/ 14 Baitulla Ismail Shaikh And Anr vs Khatija Ismail Panhalkar And Ors. on 30 January, 2024 of the subsequent notices. The tenants shall also be entitled to question the legality thereof, if so advised. 18. We are conscious that the Revisional Court was examining a judgment and decree already tested by the Appellate Forum and on facts, decree was made. Ordinarily the Revisional Court ought not to interfere with findings on fact. But in the judgment under appeal, we find that the Revisional Court has fitted the facts with the legal provisions and found that there was mismatch on the basis of which the judgment and decree were set aside. We have been taken through the judgment of the Revisional Court and do not find any flaw that needs re-appreciation. We accordingly dismiss both the appeals. 19. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of. ……………………………….J. (ANIRUDDHA BOSE) ……………………………….J. (BELA M.
